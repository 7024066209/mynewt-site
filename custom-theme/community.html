                <h3>Bug Submission and Issue Tracking</h3>
                <p>Issues, features, improvements, and wish-lists are tracked using <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/Mynewt/">ASF JIRA</a>, the Atlassian JIRA software on Apache Software Foundation </p>
                <li>
                Sign up for an account on JIRA and submit a request to the dev@ mailing list for your JIRA username to be added to the Apache Mynewt (MYNEWT) project. Editing a ticket requires an account.
                </li>
                <li> Log in and report a bug by choosing the "MYNEWT" project, clicking on the "Create" button, and creating a ticket with an appropriate Issue Type (e.g. Bug, Wish).  </p>
                <p> If you are a contributor and wish to work on a change, open a JIRA ticket first. It's always a good idea to introduce the change in the dev@ mailing list and refer to that ticket. When you generate a pull request into the github mirror for your change, always reference the JIRA ticket number in the title. JIRA is set up to resolve the ticket when your code is merged into the ASF git repository and the pull request closed. </p>

                <h3>Contributing</h3>
                <p>
                You can start contributing right away, even if you are not a committer on Apache Mynewt! One requirement is that you adhere to the Apache's proposed workflow as explained <a href="https://git-wip-us.apache.org/docs/workflow.html">here</a>. Basically, you submit your initial edits for your peers to review and merge. After a few successful patches under your belt, you will get access to commit code directly to the module you are working on in the repository. And over time, you will get full access to all the repositories, where you can commit code to any module on the apache git repository (and not the github mirror). </p>
                <p>The diagram below explains the recommended process for submitting code to the core repository of Apache Mynewt. The "develop" branch on Mynewt's repository contains the most recent changes made by the community of developers. Contributions from you need to go into this branch. The essential steps are the following: </p>
                <ol> 
                <li> Fork the Mynewt repository to create your very own repo on github. </li>
                <li> Clone the Mynewt repository on your machine using the Newt tool. Set up the remotes correctly as shown in the diagram. This is key to making sure you correctly pull the latest code from Mynewt's "develop" and push to your working branch on github. </li>
                <li> Make your code changes and commit them locally. </li>
                <li> Always sync up with the latest code in the "develop" branch and resolve any merge conflicts. </li>
                <li> Push your commits to your working branch on github.
                <li> Submit a pull request to the `develop` branch of the appropriate Apache Mynewt repository by clicking the green "New pull request" button on your github fork page. </li>
                </ol>
                
                <br>

                <p> Remember there are three repositories to work with in the Apache Mynewt project. All of them have a "develop" branch which contains the latest code. The code from "develop" is merged periodically into "master" on all these repositories and releases are then tagged off the "master" branch. 
                <ul>
                   <li><a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-core">Apache Mynewt core repo mirrored on github</a></li>
                   <li><a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-newt">Apache Mynewt newt tool repo mirrored on github</a></li>
                   <li><a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-site">Apache Mynewt documentation repo mirrored on github</a></li>
                </ul>                
                <br>
                <p> <mark>The bottomline is to work with the "develop" branch. </mark> It has the latest code and you want your changes tested, working, and merged with that codebase. In the comment for the pull request, include a description of the changes you have made and why. Github will automatically notify everyone on the commits@mynewt.incubator.apache.org mailing list about the newly opened pull requests. You can open a pull request even if you don't think the code is ready for merging but want some discussion on the matter. </p>
                <p> <mark>There is no need to open a new pull request if you have already submitted a pull request against the "develop" branch on the mirror but have modified your code futher </mark>(e.g. after some feedback from the community or another clever idea popping into your head). The old pull request will get updated with your changes.</p>
                <p> Upon receiving notification, one or more committers will review your work, ask for edits or clarifications, and merge when your proposed changes are ready.</p>
