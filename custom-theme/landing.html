                    <h2>Bluetooth Low Energy</h2>

                    <p>Run Mynewt’s BLE 4.2 stack NimBLE as a complete stack or choose only its host or its controller part.</p>

                    <p>Mynewt offers NimBLE, a complete Bluetooth Low Energy 4.2 stack featuring source code for both host and controller subsystems. The standardized Hardware Controller Interface (HCI) allows you to mix and match Mynewt’s host or controller portion with another vendor’s controller or host implementation respectively, to suit your product hardware and application.

The controller implementation is available for a growing list of System on Chips (SoC). It is powerful and flexible, having demonstrated up to 32 concurrent BLE connections between a central and its peripherals. Since Mynewt’s controller exposes several more configuration options than a typical SoC vendor’s implementation, performance can be dramatically increased. For example, by maximizing the packet size and the connection event span in a connection interval using Mynewt, an nRF52 chip from Nordic Semiconductor can achieve 10x the throughput possible with the built-in Soft Device.

                        Mynewt offers a choice of high-performance networking stacks suitable for a range of IoT applications. It includes native support for the pervasive TCP/IP networking protocol suite. It offers Wi-Fi services to an application via a socket API that accesses Wi-Fi controllers and an abstracted interface to Wi-Fi supplicants. Mynewt also includes protocols with considerations and optimizations for constrained devices such as CoAP, 6LoWPAN, and of course, BLE. Several other protocols appropriate for IoT applications are under consideration in the community.

                    <h2>Secure</h2>

                    <p>Ensure security is built into the code as well as lifecycle management for your product.</p>

                        Mynewt goes beyond providing crypto libraries for secure connections between devices or between a service and remote devices to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all concerned assets. It also provides the framework and functionality to manage a device securely from its birth to end of life. Mynewt offers a secure bootloader that verifies the authenticity and integrity of firmware image before booting from it. It enables secure image upgrade both remotely over-the-air and locally through a serial interface. With an abstracted interface to hardware security features such as secure memory and crypto accelerators, Mynewt enables components like the BLE stack as well as applications to leverage them easily.
