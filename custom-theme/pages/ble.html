    <h2>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE 4.2) </h2>
    <p>
      
   For low power IoT applications, Mynewt offers NimBLE, a complete Bluetooth Low Energy 4.2 stack featuring source code for both host and controller subsystems. You can choose to run NimBLE as a complete stack or use only its host or its controller part. The standardized Hardware Controller Interface (HCI) allows you to mix and match Mynewt’s host or controller portion with another vendor’s controller or host implementation respectively, to suit your product hardware and application. 
    </p>
    <p>
The controller implementation is available for a growing list of System on Chips (SoC). It is powerful and flexible, having demonstrated up to 32 concurrent BLE connections between a central and its peripherals. Since Mynewt’s controller exposes several more configuration options than a typical SoC vendor’s implementation, performance can be dramatically increased. For example, by maximizing the packet size and the connection event span in a connection interval using Mynewt, an nRF52 chip from Nordic Semiconductor can achieve 10x the throughput possible with the built-in Soft Device.
