## Blinky, Your Hello World!

### Objective

Learn how to use packages from a default application repository of Mynewt to build your first *Hello World* application (Blinky) on a target board. Once built using *newt* tool, this application will blink the LED lights on the target board. Fun stuff!

This tutorial will guide to achieve the following, assuming you have already set up the environment on your computer to use Mynewt OS and newt tool:

Download packages and use tools to create a runtime image for a board to make its LED blink. You have two choices here:
    * [Download an image to SRAM](#use-sram-to-make-led-blink), or 
    * [Download it to flash](#use-flash-to-make-led-blink).

** Time Requirement**: Allow yourself a couple of hours for this project if you are relatively new to embedded systems and playing with development boards. Those jumpers can be pesky!


### What you need

1. STM32-E407 development board from Olimex. You can order it from [http://www.mouser.com](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Olimex-Ltd/STM32-E407/?qs=UN6GZl1KCcit6Ye0xmPO4A%3D%3D), [http://www.digikey.com](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/STM32-E407/1188-1093-ND/3726951), and other places.
2. ARM-USB-TINY-H connector with JTAG interface for debugging ARM microcontrollers (comes with the ribbon cable to hook up to the board)
3. USB A-B type cable to connect the debugger to your personal computer
4. Personal Computer with Mac OS (Mac: OS X Yosemite Version 10.10.5) or Linux box (Ubuntu 14.10: Utopic Unicorn)
5. An account on Github repository and *git* installed on your computer.
6. It assumed you already installed native tools described [here](../get_started/native_tools.md)

Also, we assume that you're familiar with UNIX shells.

Let's gets started!


### Use SRAM to make LED blink

If you wish to build the image to run from the onboard SRAM on Olimex board, follow the steps below:
#### Preparing the Software

* Make sure the PATH environment variable includes the $HOME/dev/go/bin directory. 

* If you have cloned the core repository for the simulator test in the previous section, you can skip this step. Otherwise, you have to create a repository for the project. Go to ~/dev and clone the core repository from the apache git repository into a local directory named `core`.

```no-highlight
    $ cd ~/dev 
    $ git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-core.git core
    $ ls

    go	core
    $ ls core
        DISCLAIMER         compiler       repository.yml
        LICENSE            fs             scripts
        NOTICE             hw             sys
        README.md          libs           targets
        RELEASE_NOTES.md   net
        apps               project.yml

``` 
    
* Change directory to ~/dev/core directory and build the *blinky* project inside core, using the *newt* tool. Starting with the target name, assign specific aspects of the project, as shown below, to pull the appropriate packages and build the right bundle or list for the board. For example, we set the architecture (arch), compiler, board support package (bsp), project, and compiler mode.

    (Remember to prefix each command with "newtvm" if you are executing the newt command in a Linux virtual machine on your Windows box!)

```no-highlight
    $ cd ~/dev/core
    $  newt target create blinky
    Target targets/blinky successfully created
    $ newt target set blinky arch=cortex_m4
    Target targets/blinky successfully set target.arch to cortex_m4
    $ newt target set blinky compiler=arm-none-eabi-m4
    Target targets/blinky successfully set target.compiler to ...
    $  newt target set blinky compiler_def=debug
    Target targets/blinky successfully set target.compiler_def to debug
    $ newt target set blinky bsp=hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard
    Target targets/blinky successfully set target.bsp to ...
    $ newt target set blinky app=apps/blinky
    Target targets/blinky successfully set target.app to apps/blinky
    $ newt target show blinky
    targets/blinky
        app=apps/blinky
        arch=cortex_m4
        bsp=hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard
        compiler=arm-none-eabi-m4
        compiler_def=debug

```

* Next, let's build the image with the above values assigned. By default, the linker script within the `hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard` package builds an image for flash memory, which we don't want; instead, we want an image for the SRAM, so you need to switch that script with `run_from_sram.ld`. 

<font color="red">
(We are working to simplify this scheme whereby an executable for a project will correctly elect the linker scripts and generate the relevant image. For example, the scheme will key on project identity such as bootloader, RAM, Flash (default) and build accordingly. </font>.)

Afer you build the target, you can find the executable *blinky.elf* in the project directory *~/dev/core/bin/blinky/apps/blinky/.* 
    
```no-highlight
    $ cd ~/dev/core/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard
    $ diff olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld run_from_sram.ld
    (some diff will be displayed)
    $ cp run_from_sram.ld olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld
    $ cd ~/dev/core
    $ newt build blinky
    Compiling case.c
    Compiling suite.c
    ...
    Linking blinky.elf
    App successfully built:~/dev/core/bin/blinky/apps/blinky/blinky.elf    
    $ ls bin/blinky/apps/blinky/
        blinky.elf      blinky.elf.bin     blinky.elf.cmd  
        blinky.elf.lst  blinky.elf.map
```
 
#### Prepare the hardware to boot from embedded SRAM

* Locate the boot jumpers on the board.
![Alt Layout - Top View](pics/topview.png)
![Alt Layout - Bottom View](pics/bottomview.png)

* B1_1/B1_0 and B0_1/B0_0 are PTH jumpers. Note that because the markings on the board may not always be accurate, when in doubt, you should always refer to the manual for the correct positioning. Since the jumpers are a pair, they should move together, and as such, the pair is responsible for the boot mode when bootloader is present. 
To locate the bootloader, the board searches in three places: User Flash Memory, System Memory or the Embedded SRAM. For this Blinky project, we will configure it to boot from SRAM by jumpering **B0_1** and **B1_1**.

* Connect USB-OTG#2 in the picture above to a USB port on your computer (or a powered USB hub to make sure there is enough power available to the board). 

* The red PWR LED should be lit. 

* Connect the JTAG connector to the SWD/JTAG interface on the board. The other end of the cable should be connected to the USB port or hub of your computer.

#### Let's Go!

* Ensure that you are in the blinky project directory with the *blinky.elf* executable. Run the debug command in the *newt* tool. You'll see some status messages as shown below. In case you need to halt the debugging session, you can issue an `-c "reset halt"` command.
```no-highlight
    $ cd ~/dev/core
    $ newt debug blinky

    Info : accepting 'gdb' connection on tcp/3333
    Info : device id = 0x10036413
    Info : flash size = 1024kbytes
```

   Check the value of the msp (main service pointer) register. If it is not 0x10010000 as indicated above, you will have to manually set it after you open the gdb tool and load the image on it. For example, 
   
```no-highlight
        (gdb) set $msp=0x10010000
```
   Now load the image and type "c" or "continue" from the GNU debugger. 

```no-highlight           
        (gdb) load ~/dev/core/bin/blinky/apps/blinky/blinky.elf      
        Loading section .text, size 0x16b88 lma 0x20000000

        (gdb) c
        Continuing.
```   
      
* Voil√†! The board's LED should be blinking at 1 Hz. Success!

### Use flash to make LED blink

If you wish to build the image to run from the onboard flash memory on Olimex board, follow the steps below:

* Configure the board to boot from flash by moving the two jumpers together to **B0_0** and **B1_0**. Refer to the pictures of the board under the section titled ["Prepare the hardware to boot from embedded SRAM"](#prepare-the-hardware-to-boot-from-embedded-sram).

   You will have to reset the board once the image is uploaded to it.
        
* If you skipped the first option for the project [(downloading an image to SRAM)](#use-sram-to-make-led-blink), then skip this step. Otherwise, continue with this step. 

   By default, the linker script (`olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld`) is configured to run from bootloader and flash. However, if you first ran the image from SRAM you had changed `olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld` to match `run_from_sram.ld`. You will, therefore, return to defaults with `olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld` linker script matching the contents of 'run_from_loader.ld'. Return to the project directory.

```no-highlight
    $ cd ~/dev/core/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard
    $ diff olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld run_from_sram.ld
    $ diff olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld run_from_loader.ld
    (some diff will be displayed)
    $ cp run_from_loader.ld olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld
    $ cd ~/dev/core
```

* In order to run the image from flash, you need to build the bootloader as well. The bootloader does the initial set up of the Olimex board and then transfers control to the image stored at a location in flash known to it. 
```
Let's create boot_olimex:
```no-highlight
    $ newt target create boot_olimex
    Creating target boot_olimex
    Target boot_olimex successfully created!
    $ newt target set boot_olimex arch=cortex_m4
    Target boot_olimex successfully set arch to cortex_m4
    $ newt target set boot_olimex compiler=arm-none-eabi-m4
    Target boot_olimex successfully set compiler to arm-none-eabi-m4
    $ newt target set boot_olimex compiler_def=optimized
    Target boot_olimex successfully set compiler_def to optimized
    $ newt target set boot_olimex bsp=hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard
    Target boot_olimex successfully set bsp to ...
    $ newt target set boot_olimex app=apps/boot
    Target targets/boot_olimex successfully set target.app to apps/boot
    $ newt target show boot_olimex
    targets/boot_olimex
        app=apps/boot
        arch=cortex_m4
        bsp=hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard
        compiler=arm-none-eabi-m4
        compiler_def=optimized
```
* Now let's build both targets now.
```no-highlight
    $ newt build boot_olimex
    ...
    App successfully built: ~/dev/core/bin/boot_olimex/apps/boot/boot_olimex.elf
    $ newt  build blinky
    ...
    Linking blinky.elf
    App successfully built: ~/dev/core/bin/blinky/apps/blinky/blinky.elf
```

* Create the bootloader image and download the bootloader and the image to flash ... in a flash! 
When creating an image, you can assign a version number to your image; here we use '1.2.3'
```no-highlight
    $ newt create-image boot_olimex 1.2.3
    $ newt download boot_olimex
    $ newt create-image blinky 1.2.3
    $ newt download blinky

```

* Voil√†! The LED should be blinking! Success!

* But wait...not so fast. let's double check that it is indeed booting from flash and making the LED blink from the image in flash. Pull the USB cable off the Olimex JTAG adaptor, severing the debug connection to the JTAG port. Next power off the Olimex board by pulling out the USB cable from the board. Wait for a couple of seconds and plug the USB cable back to the board. 

   The LED light will start blinking again. Success!
  
   Note #1: If you want to download the image to flash and a gdb session opened up, use `newt debug blinky` after `newt download blinky`.

    $ newt debug blinky

   Note #2: If you want to erase the flash and load the image again you may use the following commands from within gdb. `flash erase_sector 0 0 x` tells it to erase sectors 0 through x. When you ask it to display (in hex notation) the contents of the sector starting at location 'lma,' you should see all f's. The memory location 0x8000000 is the start or origin of the flash memory contents and is specified in the olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld linker script. The flash memory locations is specific to the processor.
