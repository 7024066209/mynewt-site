## Blinky on STM32F303 board

### Objective

Download a generic firmware skeleton ("bootstrap image") that applies to any hardware and then throw in additional applicable pkgs to generate a build for a specific board, namely the STM32F303VC MCU from STMicroelectronics.

#### Hardware needed

* Discovery kit with STM32F303VC MCU
* Laptop running Mac OS


#### Step by Step Instructions to build image

* The first step is to download the generic skeleton of the project. The pkgs constituting the skeleton are not hardware architecture specific. The skeleton is maintained as an app in a separate repository on Apache. You know it is an app because there is an app.yml file. 

```no-highlight
        [user:~/dev]$ newt app create test_project
        Downloading app skeleton from https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-tadpole.git... ok!
        app test_project successfully created in ~/dev/go/test_project
    
        [user:~/dev]$ cd test_project/
        [user:~/dev/test_project]$ ls
        README.md	compiler	hw		libs	app.yml
```

* Next, the pkg-list named larva is added from the app (also named larva) from another repository on Apache. This step simply downloads the pkg-list description file and does not actually install the pkgs that constitute the pkg-list. The pkg-list description file (`pkg-list.yml`) will be used to check dependencies during the pkg install to ensure completeness. It serves as a reference for all the pkgs in the pkg-list that one can choose from and install.
```no-highlight
        [user:~/dev/test_project]$ newt app add-pkg-list larva https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-larva.git
        Downloading pkg-list.yml from https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-larva.git/master... ok!
        Verifying pkg-list.yml format...
        ok!
        pkg-list larva successfully installed to app.
```

* The next step is to install relevant pkgs from the larvan app on github. The instructions assume that you know what application or project you are interested in (the blinky application, in this case), what hardware you are using (STM32F3DISCOVERY board, in this case) and hence, what board support package you need. 

```no-highlight

        [user:~/dev/test_project]$ newt pkg install project/blinky          
        Downloading larva from https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-larva/master... ok!
        Installing project/blinky
        Installing libs/console/full
        Installing libs/shell
        Installation was a success!
    
        [user:~/dev/test_project]$ newt pkg install hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery
        Downloading larva from https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-larva/master... ok!
        Installing hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery
        Installing hw/mcu/stm/stm32f3xx
        Installing libs/cmsis-core
        Installing compiler/arm-none-eabi-m4
        Installation was a success!
```

* It's time to create a target for the project and define the target attributes. 
```no-highlight
        [user:~/dev/test_project]$ newt target create blink_f3disc
        Creating target blink_f3disc
        Target blink_f3disc successfully created!

        [user:~/dev/test_project]$ newt target set blink_f3disc project=blinky
        Target blink_f3disc successfully set project to blinky

        [user:~/dev/test_project]$ newt target set blink_f3disc bsp=hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery
        Target blink_f3disc successfully set bsp to hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery

        [user:~/dev/test_project]$ newt target set blink_f3disc compiler_def=debug
        Target blink_f3disc successfully set compiler_def to debug

        [user:~/dev/test_project]$ newt target set blink_f3disc compiler=arm-none-eabi-m4
        Target blink_f3disc successfully set compiler to arm-none-eabi-m4
        
        [user:~/dev/test_project]$ newt target set blink_f3disc arch=cortex_m4
        Target blink_f3disc successfully set arch to cortex_m4
        
        [user:~/dev/test_project]$ newt target show blink_f3disc
        blink_f3disc
	        arch: cortex_m4
	        project: blinky
	        bsp: hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery
	        compiler_def: debug
	        compiler: arm-none-eabi-m4
	        name: blink_f3disc
```        
* Next, you get to build the target and generate an executable that can then be uploaded to the board. The STM32F3DISCOVERY board includes an ST-LINK/V2 embedded debug tool interface that will be used to program/debug the board. To program the MCU on the board, simply plug in the two jumpers on CN4, as shown in the picture in red. If you want to learn more about the board you will find the User Manual at [http://www.st.com/st-web-ui/static/active/jp/resource/technical/document/user_manual/DM00063382.pdf](http://www.st.com/st-web-ui/static/active/jp/resource/technical/document/user_manual/DM00063382.pdf)

* Finally, you have to download the image on to the board. You will see a blue light start to blink.
