## List of Functions

<Comments such as these instructions are placed within angle brackets. List all the functions here. Note how the anchors work. You put the text you want to show up as a link within [] and the relevant #heading within (). Note that the header has to have at least 2 words for the anchor to work - that's how it is. "no-highlight" disables syntax highlighting. You can enable it for a particular language by specifying what the language is instead of "no-highlight". Be warned that this highlighting or no-highlighting specification may not show up nicely on Mou.>
