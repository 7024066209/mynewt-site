## Quick Start

If you are curious about Mynewt and want to get a quick feel for the project, you've come to the right place. We have three sets of instructions for you to try out.

* [Install Native Tools](native_tools.md) - to run Mynewt OS natively (on your machine)
* [Create Your First Project](project_create.md) - on simulated hardware 
* [Install Cross Tools for ARM](cross_tools.md) - to get prepared to play with hardware

**Send us an email on the dev@ mailing list if you have comments or suggestions!** If you haven't joined the mailing list, you will find the links [here](../../community.md).
