# testutil


Insert synopsis here


## Description

Describe module here, special features, how pieces fit together etc.

## Data structures

Replace this with the list of data structures used, why, any neat features

## List of Functions

<List all the functions here. Note how the anchors work. You put the text you want to show up as a link within [] and the relevant #heading within (). Note that the words of the heading need to be connected with a dash for the anchor to work. Hence the word "function" and the function name is connected with a dash, not underscore! And the header has to have at least 2 words for the anchor to work - that's how it is.>

The functions available in this OS feature are:

* [tu_init](#function-tu_init)
* [tu_restart](#function-tu_restart)
* add the rest
