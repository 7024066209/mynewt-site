Apache Mynewt's open-source embedded software comes with the following components:

  * Mynewt OS: Real-time operating system kernel (Scheduler, Mutexes, Semaphores, etc.)
  * Newt tool: Command line package management and build system 
  * Hardware Abstraction Layer unifying common MCU features (e.g. GPIOs, High Resolution Timers, PWM interfaces, UARTs, ADCs, etc.)
  * Board Support Infrastructure, that defines the framework for building software for various board architectures.
  * Image management and upgrade using the secure bootloader, and flash filesystem.
  * System configuration that allows collection of logs and statistics for all packages (with filtering options) ranging from OS-level resources such as memory pools, priorities to interface level counters such as packet exchange and queues
  * Core dump captures to enable remote diagnosis of device failures and hiccups
  * Network protocol stacks starting with BLE 4.2 (including LE Secure Connections)
