## List of Functions

<List all the functions here. Note how the anchors work. You put the text you want to show up as a link within [] and the relevant #heading within (). Note that the words of the heading need to be connected with a dash for the anchor to work. Hence the word "function" and the function name is connected with a dash, not underscore! And the header has to have at least 2 words for the anchor to work - that's how it is.>

The functions available in this OS feature are:

* [os_sanity_check_init](#function-os_sanity_check_init)
* [os_sanity_check_list_lock](#function-os_sanity_check_list_lock)
* add the rest
