#Documentation Organization

The technical literature for Apache Mynewt is organized into three manuals. The first describes the Real Time Operating System, its features as well as specifics, and how to get it running on your target. The second one describes how to use the build and packaging tool, Newt, to easily choose firmware modules for your target and compose them into a working executable. The third manual describes the device management tool, Newtmgr, to communicate with a remote device running Mynewt OS and monitor, configure, and upgrade it.

Each manual includes one or more tutorials for hands-on experience with the material described.
