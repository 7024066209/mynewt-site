Apache Mynewt is a community-driven, permissively licensed open source initiative for constrained, embedded applications. The emergence of the Internet of Things is proving that *anything that can be connected will be connected *. Many of these connected devices—wristbands and other wearables, light bulbs and locks—must be operated for long periods of time, but are constrained in terms of power, memory, and storage. Apache Mynewt flexibly addresses these constraints while remaining hardware agnostic.
