## Objective of Mynewt 


Mynewt is an open source initiative to build a stack of modularized control, networking, and monitoring software for embedded devices like wearables, lightbulbs, locks, and doorbells. At the core is a real-time operating system that is designed to work on a variety of microcontrollers. The project includes the Newt tool to help you build and distribute embedded projects using Mynewt OS. The modular implementation allows the user the flexibility to mix and match hardware components and software stack depending on the feature and performance requirements of the particular application he or she has in mind.

The world of Mynewt, therefore, has three primary collaborative goals:

* Build a modularized real-time operating system for a rich set of hardware components
* Offer a suite of open-source software for efficient and secure two-way communications with an embedded device
* Develop method and tools necessary to build an optimized executable image on the desired hardware

### Project GIT Repository

* [Documentation repository](https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-site.git) containing the markdown docs that generate the html pages you see here.

* [Mynewt OS development repository (larva)](https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-larva.git) containing all code packages for newt operating system and middleware software being worked on.

* [Newt tool development repository (newt)](https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-newt.git) containing source code for the newt tool.


### Using Project GIT Repository

For general information on using Git at Apache, go to [https://git-wip-us.apache.org](https://git-wip-us.apache.org).

If you are not a committer, follow the proposed non-committer workflow to share your work. The direct link to the proposed workflow is [https://git-wip-us.apache.org/docs/workflow.html](https://git-wip-us.apache.org/docs/workflow.html). 

To clone the Mynewt OS development repository:

* Non Committers

        $ git clone http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-larva.git

* Committers

        $ git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-larva.git
        
### Mailing Lists

* dev@mynewt.incubator.apache.org 

    This is for both contributors and users. In order to subscribe to the dev list, send an email to dev-subscribe@mynewt.incubator.apache.org.
    
* commits@mynewt.incubator.apache.org

    This is mainly for contributors to code or documentation. In order to subscribe to the commits list, send an email to commits-subscribe@mynewt.incubator.apache.org.
    
* notifications@mynewt.incubator.apache.org

    This is for all autogenerated mail except commits e.g. JIRA notifications. In order to subscribe to the notifications list, send an email to notifications-subscribe@mynewt.incubator.apache.org. 

To subscribe to a mailing list, you simply send an email to a special subscription address. To subscribe to the dev list, send an email to dev-subscribe@mynewt.incubator.apache.org. For the issues list, the address would be issues-subscribe@mynewt.incubator.apache.org. You should then get an automated email which details how to confirm your subscription.
 

### Documentation Organization

The chapter organization is outlined below. Each chapter will include one or more tutorials for hands-on experience with the material in each chapter. 

* [Chapter 1: Get Started](get_started/newt_concepts.md) introduces some key terms in this initiative and includes a tutorial for a quick project to show how to work with some of the products.

* [Chapter 2: Get Acclimated](get_acclimated/vocabulary.md) delves deeper into the concepts crucial to the software development effort. 

* [Chapter 3: Newt Tool Reference](newt/newt_ops.md) describes the command structure and details all the available commands to help you with your project. 

* [Chapter 4: Newt OS](os/mynewt_os.md) provides an overview of the features available and how to customize for your hardware and software application.

* [Chapter 5: Modules](modules/console.md) lays out all the available modules such as HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer), console, file system, networking stacks, and other middleware components.

* [Chapter 6: Creating packages for distribution](packaging/dist.md) delineates the process of creating complete packages to load on your embedded device to get it up, connected, and ready for remote management.

### Contributing to Documentation

All content on this site is statically generated using [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org) from documents written in Markdown and stored in the `docs` directory on the master branch in the [Documentation repository](https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-site.git). As a documentation contributor you will modify the desired markdown file or create new ones in the appropriate chapter subdirectory under `docs`. 

To edit content in a Markdown file and be able to see how the changes look you may use desktop apps such as:

* [Mou](http://25.io/mou/) for Mac
* [Something like Mou](http://alternativeto.net/software/mou/?platform=windows) for Windows

Click on the tutorial [How to edit docs](get_started/how_to_edit_docs.md) under "Get Started" to learn how to edit a sample file [try_markdown.md](get_started/try_markdown.md) on Mynewt's documentation git repository.

The static html content is generated and maintained in the asf-site branch in the documentation repository. Currently, the static html files are generated manually once a day. This will be automated in the future.

If you wish, you may preview the changes you have made on your desktop by installing MkDocs and starting up its built-in webserver as described in [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org). This step is optional but described in the tutorial.
