Install the PX4 Toolchain and check the version installed. Make sure that the symbolic link installed by Homebrew points to the correct version of the debugger. If not, you can either change the symbolic link using the \"ln -f -s\" command or just go ahead and try with the version it points to!\n\n\n\n\n        $ brew tap PX4/homebrew-px4\n        $ brew update\n        $ brew install gcc-arm-none-eabi-49\n        $ arm-none-eabi-gcc --version  \n        arm-none-eabi-gcc (GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors) 4.9.3 20150529 (release) [ARM/embedded-4_9-branch revision 224288]\n        Copyright (C) 2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n        This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.

MynewtOS will eventually work with multiple versions available including the latest releases. However, at present we have tested only with this version and recommend it for getting started. \n\n\n\n\nYou have to install OpenOCD (Open On-Chip Debugger) which is an open-source software that will allow you to interface with the JTAG debug connector/adaptor for the Olimex board. It lets you program, debug, and test embedded target devices which, in this case, is the Olimex board. Use brew to install it. Brew adds a simlink /usr/local/bin/openocd to the openocd directory in the Cellar. For more on OpenOCD go to \nhttp://openocd.org\n.\n\n\n\n\n        $ brew install open-ocd\n        $ which openocd\n        /usr/local/bin/openocd\n        $ ls -l $(which openocd)\n        lrwxr-xr-x  1 \nuser\n  admin  36 Sep 17 16:22 /usr/local/bin/openocd -\n ../Cellar/open-ocd/0.9.0/bin/openocd\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProceed to the \nBuilding test code on simulator\n section.\n\n\n\n\nSetting up toolchain if you have Linux\n\n\n\n\nYou have to install gcc / libc that can produce 32-bit executables. You can install these as follows: \n\n\n\n\n        $ sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib libc6-i386\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the LED project on the Olimex hardware, you have to install gcc for AM 4.9.3.  This package can be installed with apt-get as documented below. The steps are explained in depth at \nhttps://launchpad.net/~terry.guo/+archive/ubuntu/gcc-arm-embedded\n.\n\n\n\n\n        $ sudo apt-get remove binutils-arm-none-eabi gcc-arm-none-eabi \n        $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:terry.guo/gcc-arm-embedded \n        $ sudo apt-get update \n        $ sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, you have to install OpenOCD (Open On-Chip Debugger) which is an open-source software that will allow you to interface with the JTAG debug connector/adaptor for the Olimex board. It lets you program, debug, and test embedded target devices which, in this case, is the Olimex board. You have to acquire OpenOCD 0.8.0. \n\n\nIf you are running Ubuntu 15.x, then you are in luck and you can simply run: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        $ sudo apt-get install openocd \n\n\n\n\nOther versions of Ubuntu may not have the correct version of openocd available.  In this case, you should download the openocd 0.8.0 package from \nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/vivid/+source/openocd\n. The direct link to the amd64 build is \nhttp://launchpadlibrarian.net/188260097/openocd_0.8.0-4_amd64.deb\n. \n\n\n\n\nProceed to the \nBuilding test code on simulator\n section.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling newt tool\n\n\nYou can set up the environment on your computer, install the Go language, and build the newt tool from source as explained in the tutorials in the Newt Tool Manual. See \nInstall newt from source on Mac\n if you have a Mac and \nInstall newt from source on Linux\n if you have a Linux machine.\n\n\nTry building test code on simulator\n\n\n\n\nClone the larva repository from the Apache git repository into a local directory named \nlarva\n.\n\n\n\n\n        $ cd ~/dev \n        $ git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-larva.git larva\n        $ ls\n        go  larva\n        $ ls larva\n        DISCLAIMER  NOTICE      app.yml     compiler    hw      net     project     sys\n        LICENSE     README.md   autotargets fs  libs    pkg-list.yml    scripts\n\n\n\n\n2.  Create a target using the newt tool. \n\n\n        $ cd larva\n        $ newt target create sim_test\n        Creating target sim_test\n        Target sim_test sucessfully created!\n        $ newt target show\n        sim_test\n            name: sim_test\n            arch: sim\n\n\n\n\n3. Now continue to populate and build out the sim project.\n\n\n        $ newt target set sim_test project=test\n        Target sim_test successfully set project to test\n        $ newt target set sim_test compiler_def=debug\n        Target sim_test successfully set compiler_def to debug\n        $ newt target set sim_test bsp=hw/bsp/native\n        Target sim_test successfully set bsp to hw/bsp/native\n        $ newt target set sim_test compiler=sim\n        Target sim_test successfully set compiler to sim\n        $ newt target show sim_test\n        sim_test\n            arch=sim\n            bsp=hw/bsp/native\n            compiler=sim\n            compiler_def=debug\n            name=sim_test\n            project=test\n\n\n\n\n4. Configure newt to use the gnu build tools native to OS X or linux. In order for sim to work properly, it needs to be using 32-bit gcc (gcc-5). Replace \n~/dev/larva/compiler/sim/compiler.yml with the compiler/sim/osx-compiler.yml or linux-compiler.yml file, depending on the system. On a Windows machine follow the instruction for the Linux machine as you are running commands in a Linux VM.\n\n\nFor a Mac OS X environment:\n\n\n        $ cp compiler/sim/osx-compiler.yml compiler/sim/compiler.yml \n\n\n\n\nFor a Linux machine:\n\n\n        $ cp compiler/sim/linux-compiler.yml compiler/sim/compiler.yml\n\n\n\n\n5. Next, build the packages for the sim project using the newt tool. You can specify the VERBOSE option if you want to see the gory details. \n\n\n        $ newt target build sim_test\n        Building target sim_test (project = test)\n        ...\n        ...\n        Successfully run!\n\n\n\n\nYou can specify the VERBOSE option if you want to see the gory details.\n\n\n        $newt -l VERBOSE target build sim_test\n        2015/09/29 09:46:12 [INFO] Building project test\n        2015/09/29 09:46:12 [INFO] Loading Package /Users/aditihilbert/dev/larva/libs//bootutil...\n        2015/09/29 09:46:12 [INFO] Loading Package /Users/aditihilbert/dev/larva/libs//cmsis-core...\n        2015/09/29 09:46:12 [INFO] Loading Package /Users/aditihilbert/dev/larva/libs//ffs..\n        ...\n        Successfully run!\n\n\n\n\n6.

Otherwise, you have to create a repository for the project. Go to ~/dev and clone the larva repository from the apache git repository into a local directory named \nlarva\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        $ cd ~/dev \n        $ git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-larva.git larva\n        $ ls\n        go  larva\n        $ ls larva\n        DISCLAIMER  NOTICE      app.yml     compiler    hw      net     project     sys\n        LICENSE     README.md   autotargets fs  libs    pkg-list.yml    scripts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou now have to go to the ~dev/larva directory and build out a second project inside larva (the first one being the sim project). The project name is \"blinky\", in keeping with the objective. Starting with the target name, you have to specify the different aspects of the project to pull the appropriate packages and build the right bundle or list for the board. In this case that means setting the architecture (arch), compiler, board support package (bsp), project, and compiler mode.\n\n\nRemember to prefix each command with \"newtvm\" if you are executing the newt command in a Linux virtual machine on your Windows box!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        $ newt target create blinky\n        Creating target blinky\n        Target blinky sucessfully created!\n        $ newt target set blinky arch=cortex_m4\n        Target blinky successfully set arch to arm\n        $ newt target set blinky compiler=arm-none-eabi-m4\n        Target blinky successfully set compiler to arm-none-eabi-m4\n        $ newt target set blinky project=blinky\n        Target blinky successfully set project to blinky\n        $ newt target set blinky compiler_def=debug\n        Target blinky successfully set compiler_def to debug\n        $ newt target set blinky bsp=hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard\n        Target blinky successfully set bsp to hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard\n        $ newt target show blinky\n        blinky\n            arch=cortex_m4\n            bsp=hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard\n            compiler=arm-none-eabi-m4\n            compiler_def=debug\n            name=blinky\n            project=blinky\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you have to build the image. The linker script within the \nhw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard\n package builds an image for flash memory by default. Since you want an image for the SRAM, you need to switch that script with \nrun_from_sram.ld\n in order to get the package to produce an image for SRAM. \n We are working on making it easier to specify where the executable will be run from for a particular project and automatically choose the correct linker scripts and generate the appropriate image. It will be specified as a project identity e.g. bootloader, RAM, flash (default) and the target will build accordingly. \n. \n\n\nOnce the target is built, you can find the executable \"blinky.elf\" in the project directory at ~/dev/larva/project/blinky/bin/blinky. It's a good idea to take a little time to understand the directory structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        $ cd ~/dev/larva/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard\n        $ diff olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld run_from_sram.ld\n        (some diff will be displayed)\n        $ cp run_from_sram.ld olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld\n        $ cd ~/dev/larva/project/blinky/\n        $ newt target build blinky\n        Building target blinky (project = blinky)\n        Compiling case.c\n        Compiling suite.c\n        ...\n        Successfully run!\n        $ ls bin/blinky\n        blinky.elf  blinky.elf.bin  blinky.elf.cmd  blinky.elf.lst  blinky.elf.map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck that you have all the scripts needed to get OpenOCD up and talking with the project's specific hardware. Depending on your system (Ubuntu, Windows) you may already have the scripts in your \n/usr/share/openocd/scripts/\n directory as they may have been part of the openocd download. If yes, you are all set and can proceed to preparing the hardware.\n\n\nOtherwise check the \n~/dev/larva/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard\n directory for a file named \nf407.cfg\n. That is the config we will use to talk to this specific hardware using OpenOCD. You are all set if you see it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        $ ls ~/dev/larva/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard\n        bin     include     olimex_stm32-e407_devboard_download.sh  run_from_loader.ld\n        boot-olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld  olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld   pkg.yml     run_from_sram.ld\n        f407.cfg        olimex_stm32-e407_devboard_debug.sh run_from_flash.ld           src\n\n\n\n\nPreparing the hardware to boot from embedded SRAM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocate the boot jumpers on the board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB1_1/B1_0 and B0_1/B0_0 are PTH jumpers which can be moved relatively easy. Note that the markings on the board may not always be accurate. Always refer to the manual for the correct positioning of jumpers in case of doubt. The two jumpers must always be moved together \u2013 they are responsible for the boot mode if bootloader is present. The board can search for bootloader on three places \u2013 User Flash Memory, System Memory or the Embedded SRAM. We will configure it to boot from SRAM by jumpering B0_1 and B1_1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect USB-OTG#2 in the picture above to a USB port on your computer (or a powered USB hub to make sure there is enough power available to the board). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe red PWR LED should be lit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect the JTAG connector to the SWD/JTAG interface on the board. The other end of the cable should be connected to the USB port or hub of your computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's Go!\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you are in the blinky project directory with the blinky.elf executable. Run the debug command in the newt tool. You should see some status messages are shown below. There is an inbuilt \n-c \"reset halt\"\n flag that tells it to halt after opening the session.\n\n\n\n\n        $ cd ~/dev/larva/project/blinky/bin/blinky\n        $ newt target debug blinky\n        Debugging with /Users/aditihilbert/dev/larva/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard_debug.sh blinky\n        Debugging /Users/aditihilbert/dev/larva/project/blinky/bin/blinky/blinky.elf\n        GNU gdb (GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors) 7.8.0.20150604-cvs\n        Copyright (C) 2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n        License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later \nhttp://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html\n\n        ...\n        (info)\n        ...\n        target state: halted\n        target halted due to debug-request, current mode: Thread \n        xPSR: 0x01000000 pc: 0x20000250 msp: 0x10010000\n        Info : accepting 'gdb' connection from 3333\n        Info : device id = 0x10036413\n        Info : flash size = 1024kbytes\n        Reset_Handler () at startup_STM32F40x.s:199\n        199     ldr    r1, =__etext\n\n\n\n\nCheck the value of the msp (main service pointer) register.

The board's LED should be blinking at 1 Hz.\n\n\n\n\nUsing flash to make LED blink\n\n\nYou are here because you want to build an image to be run from flash memory on the Olimex board.\n\n\n\n\nConfigure the board to boot from flash by moving the two jumpers together to B0_0 and B1_0. Refer to the pictures of the board under the section titled \n\"Preparing the hardware to boot from embedded SRAM\"\n.\n\n\n\n\nYou will have to reset the board once the image is uploaded to it.\n\n\n\n\nIf you skipped the first option for the project \n(downloading an image to SRAM)\n, then skip this step. Otherwise, continue with this step. \n\n\n\n\nBy default, the linker script (\nolimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld\n) is configured to run from bootloader and flash. However, if you first ran the image from SRAM you had changed \nolimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld\n to match \nrun_from_sram.ld\n. You will therefore return to defaults with \nolimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld\n linker script matching the contents of 'run_from_loader.ld'. Return to the project directory.\n\n\n        $ cd ~/dev/larva/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard\n        $ diff olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld run_from_sram.ld\n        $ diff olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld run_from_loader.ld\n        (some diff will be displayed)\n        $ cp run_from_loader.ld olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld\n        $ cd ~/dev/larva/project/blinky/bin/blinky\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to run the image from flash, you need to build the bootloader as well. The bootloader does the initial bring up of the Olimex board and then transfers control to the image stored at a location in flash known to it. The bootloader in turn requires the bin2image tool to check the image header for version information, CRC checks etc. So, we will need to build these two additional targets (bootloader and bin2img).\n\n\n\n\nLet's first create bin2img:\n\n\n        $ newt target create bin2img\n        Creating target bin2img\n        Target bin2img successfully created!\n        $ newt target set bin2img arch=sim\n        Target bin2img successfully set arch to sim\n        $ newt target set bin2img compiler=sim\n        Target bin2img successfully set compiler to sim\n        $ newt target set bin2img project=bin2img\n        Target bin2img successfully set project to bin2img\n        $ newt target set bin2img compiler_def=debug\n        Target bin2img successfully set compiler_def to debug\n        $ newt target set bin2img bsp=hw/bsp/native\n        Target bin2img successfully set bsp to hw/bsp/native\n        $ newt target show bin2img\n        bin2img\n                arch=sim\n                bsp=hw/bsp/native\n                compiler=sim\n                compiler_def=debug\n                name=bin2img\n                project=bin2img\n\n\n\n\nAnd then let's create boot_olimex:\n\n\n        $ newt target create boot_olimex\n        Creating target boot_olimex\n        Target boot_olimex successfully created!\n        $ newt target set boot_olimex arch=cortex_m4\n        Target boot_olimex successfully set arch to cortex_m4\n        $ newt target set boot_olimex compiler=arm-none-eabi-m4\n        Target boot_olimex successfully set compiler to arm-none-eabi-m4\n        $ newt target set boot_olimex project=boot\n        Target boot_olimex successfully set project to boot\n        $ newt target set boot_olimex compiler_def=optimized\n        Target boot_olimex successfully set compiler_def to optimized\n        $ newt target set boot_olimex bsp=hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard\n        Target boot_olimex successfully set bsp to hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard\n        $ newt target show boot_olimex\n        boot_olimex\n                arch=cortex_m4\n                bsp=hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard\n                compiler=arm-none-eabi-m4\n                compiler_def=optimized\n                name=boot_olimex\n                project=boot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's build all the three targets now.\n\n\n\n\n        $ newt target build bin2img\n        Building target bin2img (project = bin2img)\n        Building project bin2img\n        ...\n        Successfully run!\n        $ newt target build boot_olimex\n        Building target boot_olimex (project = boot)\n        Building project boot\n        ...\n        Successfully run!\n        $ newt target build blinky\n        Building target blinky (project = blinky)\n        Building project blinky\n        Successfully run!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to the project directory and download the bootloader and the image to flash ... in a flash! \n\n\n\n\n        $ cd ~/dev/larva/project/blinky/bin/blinky\n        $ newt target download boot_olimex\n        Downloading with ~/dev/larva/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard_download.sh\n        $ newt target download blinky\n        Downloading with ~/dev/larva/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard_download.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LED should be blinking!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut wait...let's double check that it is indeed booting from flash and making the LED blink from the image in flash. Pull the USB cable off the Olimex JTAG adaptor. The debug connection to the JTAG port is now severed. Next power off the Olimex board by pulling out the USB cable from the board. Wait for a couple of seconds and plug the USB cable back to the board. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LED light will start blinking again.

If you have cloned the larva repository for the simulator test in the previous section you can skip this step. Otherwise, you have to create a repository for the project.

The project name is \"blinky\", in keeping with the objective. Starting with the target name, you have to specify the different aspects of the project to pull the appropriate packages and build the right bundle or list for the board. In this case that means setting the architecture (arch), compiler, board support package (bsp), project, and compiler mode.  Remember to prefix each command with \"newtvm\" if you are executing the newt command in a Linux virtual machine on your Windows box!            $ newt target create blinky\n        Creating target blinky\n        Target blinky sucessfully created!\n        $ newt target set blinky arch=cortex_m4\n        Target blinky successfully set arch to arm\n        $ newt target set blinky compiler=arm-none-eabi-m4\n        Target blinky successfully set compiler to arm-none-eabi-m4\n        $ newt target set blinky project=blinky\n        Target blinky successfully set project to blinky\n        $ newt target set blinky compiler_def=debug\n        Target blinky successfully set compiler_def to debug\n        $ newt target set blinky bsp=hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard\n        Target blinky successfully set bsp to hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard\n        $ newt target show blinky\n        blinky\n            arch=cortex_m4\n            bsp=hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard\n            compiler=arm-none-eabi-m4\n            compiler_def=debug\n            name=blinky\n            project=blinky    Now you have to build the image. The linker script within the  hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard  package builds an image for flash memory by default. Since you want an image for the SRAM, you need to switch that script with  run_from_sram.ld  in order to get the package to produce an image for SRAM.   We are working on making it easier to specify where the executable will be run from for a particular project and automatically choose the correct linker scripts and generate the appropriate image. It will be specified as a project identity e.g. bootloader, RAM, flash (default) and the target will build accordingly.  .   Once the target is built, you can find the executable \"blinky.elf\" in the project directory at ~/dev/larva/project/blinky/bin/blinky. It's a good idea to take a little time to understand the directory structure.            $ cd ~/dev/larva/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard\n        $ diff olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld run_from_sram.ld\n        (some diff will be displayed)\n        $ cp run_from_sram.ld olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld\n        $ cd ~/dev/larva/project/blinky/\n        $ newt target build blinky\n        Building target blinky (project = blinky)\n        Compiling case.c\n        Compiling suite.c\n        ...\n        Successfully run!\n        $ ls bin/blinky\n        blinky.elf  blinky.elf.bin  blinky.elf.cmd  blinky.elf.lst  blinky.elf.map    Check that you have all the scripts needed to get OpenOCD up and talking with the project's specific hardware. Depending on your system (Ubuntu, Windows) you may already have the scripts in your  /usr/share/openocd/scripts/  directory as they may have been part of the openocd download. If yes, you are all set and can proceed to preparing the hardware.  Otherwise check the  ~/dev/larva/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard  directory for a file named  f407.cfg . That is the config we will use to talk to this specific hardware using OpenOCD. You are all set if you see it.            $ ls ~/dev/larva/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard\n        bin     include     olimex_stm32-e407_devboard_download.sh  run_from_loader.ld\n        boot-olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld  olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld   pkg.yml     run_from_sram.ld\n        f407.cfg        olimex_stm32-e407_devboard_debug.sh run_from_flash.ld           src",

Configure the board to boot from flash by moving the two jumpers together to B0_0 and B1_0. Refer to the pictures of the board under the section titled  \"Preparing the hardware to boot from embedded SRAM\" .   You will have to reset the board once the image is uploaded to it.   If you skipped the first option for the project  (downloading an image to SRAM) , then skip this step. Otherwise, continue with this step.    By default, the linker script ( olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld ) is configured to run from bootloader and flash. However, if you first ran the image from SRAM you had changed  olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld  to match  run_from_sram.ld . You will therefore return to defaults with  olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld  linker script matching the contents of 'run_from_loader.ld'.

Go to the project directory and download the bootloader and the image to flash ... in a flash!            $ cd ~/dev/larva/project/blinky/bin/blinky\n        $ newt target download boot_olimex\n        Downloading with ~/dev/larva/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard_download.sh\n        $ newt target download blinky\n        Downloading with ~/dev/larva/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard_download.sh    The LED should be blinking!    But wait...let's double check that it is indeed booting from flash and making the LED blink from the image in flash. Pull the USB cable off the Olimex JTAG adaptor. The debug connection to the JTAG port is now severed. Next power off the Olimex board by pulling out the USB cable from the board. Wait for a couple of seconds and plug the USB cable back to the board.     The LED light will start blinking again. Success!

It is meant to be the workspace containing a logical collection of the source code for one or more of your projects. An app can contain multiple projects, and reflect multiple end products. \n\n\nAs the base repository of your source code, the app has a master branch and several other branches off it. The \nmaster\n is typically what developers commit to. When it is time to get the code ready for a release, a code freeze occurs on the \nmaster\n branch. A temporary \ndevelop\n branch is opened up for contributors to continue committing their code to. After the release is tagged off the \nmaster\n, the \ndevelop\n branch is merged into \nmaster\n. Developers can thereafter go back to commiting changes to \nmaster\n. The \ndevelop\n branch is subsequently deleted. You may also choose to create your own branch and work there.\n\n\nYou can have several \nprojects\n in your app repository since an application can be used in several projects. Each project in your app will, in turn, consist of several \npackages\n. A project could be a package itself as well. In addition to packages, your app repository will contain additional items such as \ntarget\n or build definitions, \npackage list\n description files, scripts etc.\n\n\nFor example, a walk through the \"larva\" nest at \nhttps://github.com/mynewt/larva.git\n shows the following structure. The nest.yml file in the larva directory indicates that it is a nest. An egg will have the egg.yml file in it as shown below.

In general, commands represent actions and flags are modifiers for those actions. A command can have children commands and optionally run an action. A full description of the \nnest\n command can be found in the newt tool reference in Chapter 3.\n\n\n    newt nest [flags]\n    newt nest [child-commands] \n\n\n\n\nA complete list of all the nest commands can be found in the newt tool reference in \nNewt Tool\n.\n\n\nProject\n\n\nProjects represent the individual build configurations of your embedded system and essentially defines your application. The project files are what dictate the resulting binary that is generated. \n\n\nLayout-wise, a project is a directory inside an app and contains packages required for a certain application. For example, the \nblinky\n egg sits in \nproject/blinky\n directory of the \nlarva\n nest. This egg is used in the blinky project (application) outlined in \nGet Started\n. \nNote: This Will Change\n\n\nA project has the following concepts or properties associated with it. You can find them in the \nproject-name\n.yml\n file in the project directory. For example, the \nproject/blinky\n directory has the \nblinky.yml\n file indicating some or all of the properties below. Only the name of a project is required for the project to exist, however additional properties may need to be specified for the eggs in it to compile properly and produce an executable. \n\n\n\n\nProject name\n\n\nBase path of the project (nest/project/project-name by default)\n\n\nEggs belonging to the project\n\n\nCapabilities\n that are required for the project or target \n\n\nIdentity\n to classify the type of project or target\n\n\nCompiler flags to call out any specific compiler requirement\n\n\n\n\nA project could itself be an egg if it is a distributable package for a specific application. \n\n\nThe newt tool offers various commands that you can use with a project. For example, if your project is an egg, you can use the following command to install a project from a nest.\n\n\n    newt egg install [flags] \nproject egg name\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage or pkg\n\n\nA package (pkg) is a distributable bundle of libraries. Just as an egg in nature has various parts each of which serves a certain purpose, the Mynewt egg consists of software parcels or modules that have different functions. However, unlike the egg in nature these software modules can exist by itself and may be distributed; therefore, they too are essentially eggs. Once this concept is grasped it is easy to see how an egg may consist of other eggs.\n\n\nThe two main directories in an egg are \n/include\n and \n/src\n.\n\n\nThe newt tool offers several egg commands to list, inspect, install, and do other operations on eggs. For example, the following command\n\n\n    newt egg list \n\n\n\n\noutputs all the eggs in the current nest where each egg has details on its version, path, and dependencies. A sample output for an egg is given below.\n\n\n    Egg libs/os, version 0.1.0\n    path: /Users/aditihilbert/dev/test_project/libs/os\n    deps: libs/testutil@none#stable \n\n\n\n\nA complete list of all the egg commands can be found in the newt tool reference in \nNewt Tool\n.\n\n\nPackage list or pkg-list\n\n\nA clutch is a snapshot of all eggs in a remote nest at any point in time. On any given github branch, a nest with a clutch of eggs will contain a \nclutch.yml\n file that specifies the version number, dependencies, and hash value for each constituent egg as well as the name of the entire clutch and the github url for it. [Note: Currently ]\n\n\nYou may download multiple clutches into your local nest as long as the names of the clutches are different. This allows you to mix and match various features and functionality coming from different clutches of eggs. You can see all the clutches in the \n.nest/clutches\n directory in your nest.\n\n\nThe newt tool offers clutch management commands within the \nnewt nest\n command. For example, the following command creates a new clutch using all the eggs in the current directory. It requires that a clutch name be specified and the url for the location of that clutch in the online repository. These two inputs go into the \nclutch.yml\n file in the nest.\n\n\n    newt nest generate-clutch \nname\n \nurl\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that a clutch merely defines the eggs belonging together and requires the eggs to be installed (hatched) for the source code to be populated in the project. \n\n\nEggshell\n\n\nThe term eggshell is used to refer to the eggs of a clutch in a remote repository. They are not useful on your local machine until you actually install them. So they are mere shells of themselves while sitting on the online repository. When you enter the following command outputs the total number of shells in each remote clutch.\n\n\n    newt nest list-clutches\n\n\n\n\nSo, if you had two clutches installed, the output could be:\n\n\n    Remote clutch larva (eggshells: 19)\n    Remote clutch ble_test (eggshells: 15)\n\n\n\n\nTarget\n\n\nA target is the hardware build or its software equivalent (e.g. test, simulator) set for a project. It tells the newt tool how to build the source code within a given nest. Once a new target is created, its architecture and other details needs to be defined. An example of a defined target named \"blink_f3disc\" is given below.\n\n\n    blink_f3disc\n             compiler_def: debug\n             compiler: arm-none-eabi-m4\n             name: blink_f3disc\n             arch: cortex_m4\n             project: blinky\n             bsp: hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery\n\n\n\n\nThe newt tool offers commands to create, set up and manipulate targets. For example, the create command below creates an empty target named \nmy_target1\n and the set command sets one detail of its definition, namely the architecture.\n\n\n    newt target create my_target1\n    newt target set my_target1 arch=cortex_m4\n\n\n\n\nCapability\n\n\nCapability is functionality that is exposed by an egg. A capability is tracked by its name and version. An egg may require capabilities exposed by another egg, thus establishing a dependency tracked through the egg.yml files. \n\n\nThe newt tool can ascertain a map of all the egg capabilities and use it to check dependencies and make sure all the necessary eggs are in a project for a particular target.\n\n\nIdentity\n\n\nIdentity is a property of a target or project in the newt world. A target may inherit it from a project or vice versa. It may be used to determine what eggs to include or how an egg code should behave in a build or which linkerscripts to use. For example, the identity of a lock is different from the identity of a wearable monitor. Even if they were to be built on the same hardware target, different features and behavior are required. Their different identities result in differing sets of eggs in the projects and/or the same egg behaving differently depending on the identity.",

Note: This Will Change  A project has the following concepts or properties associated with it. You can find them in the  project-name .yml  file in the project directory. For example, the  project/blinky  directory has the  blinky.yml  file indicating some or all of the properties below. Only the name of a project is required for the project to exist, however additional properties may need to be specified for the eggs in it to compile properly and produce an executable.

Once this concept is grasped it is easy to see how an egg may consist of other eggs.  The two main directories in an egg are  /include  and  /src .  The newt tool offers several egg commands to list, inspect, install, and do other operations on eggs. For example, the following command      newt egg list   outputs all the eggs in the current nest where each egg has details on its version, path, and dependencies.

In the process you will be exposed to more Mynewt terms and Newt tool commands.\n\n\nThe following target hardware chips are covered:\n\n\n\n\nSTM32F303VC MCU\n from STMicroelectronics\n\n\nnRF52 Series\n from Nordic Semiconductors \n\n\n\n\nSTM32F303VC MCU\n\n\nHardware needed\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery kit with STM32F303VC MCU\n\n\nLaptop running Mac OS\n\n\n\n\nStep by Step Instructions to build image\n\n\n\n\nThe first step is to download the generic skeleton of the project. The eggs constituting the skeleton are not hardware architecture specific. The skeleton is maintained as a nest in a separate repository on Apache. You know it is a nest because there is a nest.yml file. \n\n\n\n\n        [user:~/dev]$ newt nest create test_project\n        Downloading nest skeleton from https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-tadpole.git... ok!\n        Nest test_project successfully created in ~/dev/go/test_project\n\n        [user:~/dev]$ cd test_project/\n        [user:~/dev/test_project]$ ls\n        README.md   compiler    hw      libs    nest.yml\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, the clutch of eggs named larva is added from the nest (also named larva) from another repository on Apache. This step simply downloads the clutch description file and does not actually install the eggs that constitute the clutch. The clutch description file (\nclutch.yml\n) will be used to check dependencies during the egg install to ensure completeness. It serves as a reference for all the eggs in the clutch that one can choose from and install.\n\n\n\n\n        [user:~/dev/test_project]$ newt nest add-clutch larva https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-larva.git\n        Downloading clutch.yml from https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-larva.git/master... ok!\n        Verifying clutch.yml format...\n        ok!\n        Clutch larva successfully installed to Nest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next step is to install relevant eggs from the larva nest on github. The instructions assume that you know what application or project you are interested in (the blinky application, in this case), what hardware you are using (STM32F3DISCOVERY board, in this case) and hence, what board support package you need. \n\n\n\n\n\n        [user:~/dev/test_project]$ newt egg install project/blinky          \n        Downloading larva from https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-larva/master... ok!\n        Installing project/blinky\n        Installing libs/console/full\n        Installing libs/shell\n        Installation was a success!\n\n        [user:~/dev/test_project]$ newt egg install hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery\n        Downloading larva from https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-larva/master... ok!\n        Installing hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery\n        Installing hw/mcu/stm/stm32f3xx\n        Installing libs/cmsis-core\n        Installing compiler/arm-none-eabi-m4\n        Installation was a success!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's time to create a target for the project and define the target attributes. \n\n\n\n\n        [user:~/dev/test_project]$ newt target create blink_f3disc\n        Creating target blink_f3disc\n        Target blink_f3disc successfully created!\n\n        [user:~/dev/test_project]$ newt target set blink_f3disc project=blinky\n        Target blink_f3disc successfully set project to blinky\n\n        [user:~/dev/test_project]$ newt target set blink_f3disc bsp=hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery\n        Target blink_f3disc successfully set bsp to hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery\n\n        [user:~/dev/test_project]$ newt target set blink_f3disc compiler_def=debug\n        Target blink_f3disc successfully set compiler_def to debug\n\n        [user:~/dev/test_project]$ newt target set blink_f3disc compiler=arm-none-eabi-m4\n        Target blink_f3disc successfully set compiler to arm-none-eabi-m4\n\n        [user:~/dev/test_project]$ newt target set blink_f3disc arch=cortex_m4\n        Target blink_f3disc successfully set arch to cortex_m4\n\n        [user:~/dev/test_project]$ newt target show blink_f3disc\n        blink_f3disc\n            arch: cortex_m4\n            project: blinky\n            bsp: hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery\n            compiler_def: debug\n            compiler: arm-none-eabi-m4\n            name: blink_f3disc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, you get to build the target and generate an executable that can then be uploaded to the board.

You can read about it at \nhttp://www.mkdocs.org\n. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool (which in our case is MkDocs).\n\n\nYou do not need to install MkDocs unless you want to actually render your documentation in HTML in order to preview it before pushing your content to the remote repository. Typically, using a Markdown editor such as \nMou\n is enough to check how it will look after the document has gone through MkDocs. Go ahead and download \nMou\n. If you are on a Windows machine, download the \neditor of your choice\n.\n\n\nCurrently someone in the project is designated to use MkDocs to generate the HTML pages periodically after changes have been reviewed and accepted into the master branch.\n\n\nAccess to the Apache repo\n\n\nGet an account on Apache. You do not need a committer account to view the website or clone the repository but you need it to push changes to it.\n\n\nIf you are not a committer, you may follow the proposed non-committer workflow to share your work. The direct link to the proposed workflow is \nhttps://git-wip-us.apache.org/docs/workflow.html\n. You will find the steps described in more detail later in this tutorial.\n\n\nMaking a local copy\n\n\n\n\nCopy the document source files into a local directory and look at the contents of the copied directory to get an idea of the directory structure. Use http instead of https if you are a non-committer.\n\n\n\n\n        $ git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-site.git\n        Cloning into 'incubator-mynewt-site'...\n        remote: Counting objects: 330, done.\n        remote: Compressing objects: 100% (263/263), done.\n        remote: Total 330 (delta 120), reused 0 (delta 0)\n        Receiving objects: 100% (330/330), 4.34 MiB | 830.00 KiB/s, done.\n        Resolving deltas: 100% (120/120), done.\n        Checking connectivity... done.\n        $ ls\n        incubator-mynewt-site\n        $ ls incubator-mynewt-site/\n        docs        images      mkdocs.yml\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new branch to work on your documentation and move to that branch.\n\n\n\n\n        $ git checkout -b \nyour-branch-name\n\n\n\n\n\nFile to be edited\n\n\nThe file you will edit is named try_markdown.md. It is in the incubator-mynewt-site/docs/os/get_acclimated/ directory.\n\n\nEditing an existing page\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the application Mou.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the file incubator-mynewt-site/docs/os/get_acclimated/try_markdown.md in Mou.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the last item on the list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave and quit the application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a new page\n\n\nIf you create a new file somewhere in the \ndocs\n subdirectory to add a new page, you have to add a line in the \nmkdocs.yml\n file at the correct level. For example, if you add a new module named \"Ethernet\" by creating a new file named \nethernet.md\n in the \nmodules\n subdirectory, you have to insert the following line under \nModules:\n in the \nmkdocs.yml\n file.\n\n\n        - 'Ethernet': 'modules/ethernet.md'\n\n\n\n\nPushing changes to remote as a committer\n\n\nIf you are not a committer yet, skip this section and proceed to the \nnext section\n.\n\n\n\n\nCheck whether your remote git repository is set up. If you see the remote location as shown below you can skip the next step.\n\n\n\n\n        $ git remote -v\n        origin  https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-site.git (fetch)\n        origin  https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-site.git (push)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf, however, you do not see your remote repository, then set it up as follows.\n\n\n\n\n        $ git remote add origin https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-site.git \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst check the git status. It will show you that the \ntry_markdown.md\n document has been modified. So you will stage a commit, and then commit the change. Finally, you will push the changes to the remote repository. \n\n\n\n\nDuring staging below using \ngit add\n, we use the \n-A\n option indicating you want to stage all your modifications. Instead, you can choose to specify only the files that you want to. The commit message (specified after \n-m\n) should summarize what your changes are about.\n\n\n        $ git status\n        $ git add -A \n        $ git commit -m \nMy first doc change as a trial run\n\n        $ git push -u origin \nyour-branch-name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see the changed Markdown file if you traverse the tree on the git repository \n https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-site.git\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA commit notification automatically goes out to the commits@mynewt.incubator.apache.org mailing list. The \"upstream\" manager pulls the notified changes, reviews it, and merges it to the master branch if all is well. Otherwise you get an email for further changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharing changes as a non-committer\n\n\nWe suggest you follow the proposed non-committer workflow at Apache to share your work. The direct link to the proposed workflow is \nhttps://git-wip-us.apache.org/docs/workflow.html\n. \n\n\n\n\nAssuming you have made changes to the example file, you will first commit your changes.\n\n\n\n\n        $ git add -A \n        $ git commit -m \nMy first doc change as a trial run\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you're ready to share your changes with the rest of the project team, you can use the git format-patch command to produce a patch file (or a nice set of patches in the future) and email the patch file to dev@mynewt.incubator.apache.org. Later on you may attach multiple files in your email to the mailing list as part of an existing thread or a new one. Remember to summarize the issue you have tackled and your work if the commit message is not detailed enough.\n\n\n\n\nIf there is a JIRA ticket associated with your work you should post your patch files to the ticket.\n\n\n        $ git format-patch origin/trunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can use the mirror on github.com to submit a pull request. The mirror is located at \nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-site\n. It is up to you to decide whether to create a fork or a branch to work in and submit pull requests from. Remember you cannot push changes to the master on the github mirror, so you have to create a fork or a branch first. Your pull request will be reviewed by a committer for docs and merged into the master branch when the changes are understood and accepted. \n\n\n\n\nConversion to HTML\n\n\nThe conversion of the Markdown files to HTML for the website happens manually and statically using MkDocs. You cannot see automatic and immediate rendering in HTML upon making a change in the Markdown file. You can choose to stop here and proceed to changing other Markdown files in your branch.\n\n\nLocal preview of HTML files\n\n\nHowever, you have the option to download MkDocs and do a local conversion yourself to preview the pages using the built-in devserver that comes with MkDocs. But first you will have to install MkDocs for that. In order to install MkDocs you'll need Python installed on your system, as well as the Python package manager, pip. You can check if you have them already (usually you will).\n\n\n        $ python --version\n        Python 2.7.2\n        $ pip --version\n        pip 1.5.2\n        $ pip install mkdocs\n\n\n\n\nYou will then run the built-in webserver from the root of the documentation directory using the command \nmkdocs serve\n. The root directory for documentation is \nincubator-mynewt-site\n or the directory with the \nmkdocs.yml\n file.\n\n\n        $ ls\n        docs        images      mkdocs.yml\n        $ mkdocs serve\n\n\n\n\nThen go to \nhttp://127.0.0.1:8000\n to preview your pages and see how they will look on the website! Remember that the Myself website itself will not be updated.\n\n\nFor more information on MkDocs go to \nhttp://www.mkdocs.org\n.",

The mirror is located at  https://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-site . It is up to you to decide whether to create a fork or a branch to work in and submit pull requests from. Remember you cannot push changes to the master on the github mirror, so you have to create a fork or a branch first.

            "text": "Task\n\n\nA task, along with the scheduler, forms the basis of the Mynewt OS. A task \nconsists of two basic elements: a task stack and a task function. The task \nfunction is basically a forever loop, waiting for some \"event\" to wake it up. \nThere are two methods used to signal a task that it has work to do: event queues \nand semaphores (see the appropriate manual sections for descriptions of these \nfeatures).\n\n\nThe Mynewt OS is a multi-tasking, preemptive OS. Every task is assigned a task \npriority (from 0 to 255), with 0 being the highest priority task. If a higher \npriority task than the current task wants to run, the scheduler preempts the \ncurrently running task and switches context to the higher priority task. This is \njust a fancy way of saying that the processor stack pointer now points to the \nstack of the higher priority task and the task resumes execution where it left \noff.\n\n\nTasks run to completion unless they are preempted by a higher priority task. The \ndeveloper must insure that tasks eventually \"sleep\"; otherwise lower priority \ntasks will never get a chance to run (actually, any task lower in priority than \nthe task that never sleeps). A task will be put to sleep in the following cases: \nit puts itself to sleep using \nos_time_delay()\n, it waits on an event queue \nwhich is empty or attempts to obtain a mutex or a semaphore that is currently \nowned by another task.\n\n\nNote that other sections of the manual describe these OS features in more \ndetail.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nIn order to create a task two data structures need to be defined: the task \nobject (struct os_task) and its associated stack. Determining the stack size can \nbe a bit tricky; generally developers should not declare large local variables \non the stack so that task stacks can be of limited size. However, all \napplications are different and the developer must choose the stack size \naccordingly. NOTE: be careful when declaring your stack! The stack is in units \nof \nos_stack_t\n sized elements (generally 32-bits). Looking at the example given \nbelow and assuming \nos_stack_t\n is defined to be a 32-bit unsigned value, \n\"my_task_stack\" will use 256 bytes. \n\n\nA task must also have an associated \"task function\". This is the function that \nwill be called when the task is first run. This task function should never \nreturn!\n\n\nIn order to inform the Mynewt OS of the new task and to have it added to the \nscheduler, the \nos_task_init()\n function is called. Once \nos_task_init()\n is \ncalled, the task is made ready to run and is added to the active task list. Note \nthat a task can be initialized (started) before or after the os has started \n(i.e. before \nos_start()\n is called) but must be initialized after the os has \nbeen initialized (i.e. 'os_init' has been called). In most of the examples and \ncurrent Mynewt projects, the os is initialized, tasks are initialized, and the \nthe os is started. Once the os has started, the highest priority task will be \nthe first task set to run.\n\n\nInformation about a task can be obtained using the \nos_task_info_get_next()\n \nAPI.

            "text": "A task, along with the scheduler, forms the basis of the Mynewt OS. A task \nconsists of two basic elements: a task stack and a task function. The task \nfunction is basically a forever loop, waiting for some \"event\" to wake it up. \nThere are two methods used to signal a task that it has work to do: event queues \nand semaphores (see the appropriate manual sections for descriptions of these \nfeatures).  The Mynewt OS is a multi-tasking, preemptive OS. Every task is assigned a task \npriority (from 0 to 255), with 0 being the highest priority task. If a higher \npriority task than the current task wants to run, the scheduler preempts the \ncurrently running task and switches context to the higher priority task. This is \njust a fancy way of saying that the processor stack pointer now points to the \nstack of the higher priority task and the task resumes execution where it left \noff.  Tasks run to completion unless they are preempted by a higher priority task. The \ndeveloper must insure that tasks eventually \"sleep\"; otherwise lower priority \ntasks will never get a chance to run (actually, any task lower in priority than \nthe task that never sleeps). A task will be put to sleep in the following cases: \nit puts itself to sleep using  os_time_delay() , it waits on an event queue \nwhich is empty or attempts to obtain a mutex or a semaphore that is currently \nowned by another task.  Note that other sections of the manual describe these OS features in more \ndetail.",

            "text": "In order to create a task two data structures need to be defined: the task \nobject (struct os_task) and its associated stack. Determining the stack size can \nbe a bit tricky; generally developers should not declare large local variables \non the stack so that task stacks can be of limited size. However, all \napplications are different and the developer must choose the stack size \naccordingly. NOTE: be careful when declaring your stack! The stack is in units \nof  os_stack_t  sized elements (generally 32-bits). Looking at the example given \nbelow and assuming  os_stack_t  is defined to be a 32-bit unsigned value, \n\"my_task_stack\" will use 256 bytes.   A task must also have an associated \"task function\". This is the function that \nwill be called when the task is first run. This task function should never \nreturn!  In order to inform the Mynewt OS of the new task and to have it added to the \nscheduler, the  os_task_init()  function is called. Once  os_task_init()  is \ncalled, the task is made ready to run and is added to the active task list. Note \nthat a task can be initialized (started) before or after the os has started \n(i.e. before  os_start()  is called) but must be initialized after the os has \nbeen initialized (i.e. 'os_init' has been called). In most of the examples and \ncurrent Mynewt projects, the os is initialized, tasks are initialized, and the \nthe os is started. Once the os has started, the highest priority task will be \nthe first task set to run.  Information about a task can be obtained using the  os_task_info_get_next()  \nAPI. Developers can walk the list of tasks to obtain information on all created \ntasks. This information is of type  os_task_info  and is described below.

            "text": "Semaphore\n\n\nA semaphore is a structure used for gaining exclusive access (much like a mutex), synchronizing task operations and/or use in a \"producer/consumer\" roles. Semaphores like the ones used by the myNewt OS are called \"counting\" semaphores as they are allowed to have more than one token (explained below).\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nA semaphore is a fairly simple construct consisting of a queue for waiting tasks and the number of tokens currently owned by the semaphore. A semaphore can be obtained as long as there are tokens in the semaphore. Any task can add tokens to the semaphore and any task can request the semaphore, thereby removing tokens. When creating the semaphore, the initial number of tokens can be set as well.\n\n\nWhen used for exclusive access to a shared resource the semaphore only needs a single token. In this case, a single task \"creates\" the semaphore by calling \nos_sem_init\n with a value of one (1) for the token. When a task desires exclusive access to the shared resource it requests the semaphore by calling \nos_sem_pend\n. If there is a token the requesting task will acquire the semaphore and continue operation. If no tokens are available the task will be put to sleep until there is a token. A common \"problem\" with using a semaphore for exclusive access is called \npriority inversion\n. Consider the following scenario: a high and low priority task both share a resource which is locked using a semaphore. If the low priority task obtains the semaphore and then the high priority task requests the semaphore, the high priority task is now blocked until the low priority task releases the semaphore. Now suppose that there are tasks between the low priority task and the high priority task that want to run. These tasks will preempt the low priority task which owns the semaphore. Thus, the high priority task is blocked waiting for the low priority task to finish using the semaphore but the low priority task cannot run since other tasks are running. Thus, the high priority tasks is \"inverted\" in priority; in effect running at a much lower priority as normally it would preempt the other (lower priority) tasks. If this is an issue a mutex should be used instead of a semaphore.\n\n\nSemaphores can also be used for task synchronization. A simple example of this would be the following. A task creates a semaphore and initializes it with no tokens. The task then waits on the semaphore, and since there are no tokens, the task is put to sleep. When other tasks want to wake up the sleeping task they simply add a token by calling \nos_sem_release\n. This will cause the sleeping task to wake up (instantly if no other higher priority tasks want to run).\n\n\nThe other common use of a counting semaphore is in what is commonly called a \"producer/consumer\" relationship. The producer adds tokens (by calling \nos_sem_release\n) and the consumer consumes them by calling \nos_sem_pend\n. In this relationship, the producer has work for the consumer to do. Each token added to the semaphore will cause the consumer to do whatever work is required. A simple example could be the following: every time a button is pressed there is some work to do (ring a bell). Each button press causes the producer to add a token. Each token consumed rings the bell. There will exactly the same number of bell rings as there are button presses. In other words, each call to \nos_sem_pend\n subtracts exactly one token and each call to \nos_sem_release\n adds exactly one token.\n\n\nData structures\n\n\nstruct os_sem\n{\n    SLIST_HEAD(, os_task) sem_head;     /* chain of waiting tasks */\n    uint16_t    _pad;\n    uint16_t    sem_tokens;             /* # of tokens */\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElement\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsem_head\n\n\nQueue head for list of tasks waiting on semaphore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_pad\n\n\nPadding for alignment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsem_tokens\n\n\nCurrent number of tokens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList of Functions\n\n\nThe functions available in semaphore are:\n\n\n\n\nos_sem_delete\n\n\nos_sem_init\n\n\nos_sem_pend\n\n\nos_sem_release",

Generally, memory pools are used when the developer wants to allocate a certain amount of memory to a given feature.

The memory block alignment is usually for efficiency but may be due to other reasons. Generally, blocks are aligned on 32-bit boundaries.

The internal watchdog is tickled frequently, and is \nmeant to be an indicator the OS is running.\n\n\nThe \nExternal Watchdog\n is a watchdog that's typically run slower.  The \npurpose of an external watchdog is to provide the system with a hard reset\nwhen it has lost its mind.  \n\n\nThe \nSanity Watchdog\n is the least frequently run watchdog, and is meant as \nan application watchdog.  \n\n\nThis document is about the operation of the Mynewt Sanity Watchdog.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nInitializing the Sanity Task\n\n\nThe Sanity Watchdog is a task in the Mynewt OS, which when enabled, runs \nevery \nsanity_seconds\n.  In order to enable the Sanity Watchdog task, \ncall the \nos_sanity_task_init()\n function.\n\n\nint os_sanity_task_init(int sanity_seconds);\n\n\n\n\nBy default, every operating system task provides the frequency it will \ncheck in with the sanity task, with the \nsanity_itvl\n parameter in the \n\nos_task_init()\n function:\n\n\nint os_task_init(struct os_task *t, char *name, os_task_func_t func, \n    void *arg, uint8_t prio, os_time_t sanity_itvl, os_stack_t *bottom,\n    uint16_t stack_size);\n\n\n\n\nsanity_itvl\n is the time in OS time ticks that the task being created \nmust register in with the sanity task.  \n\n\nChecking in with Sanity Task\n\n\nThe task must then register in with the sanity task every \nsanity_itvl\n \nseconds.  In order to do that, the task should call the \nos_sanity_task_checkin\n\nfunction, which will reset the sanity check associated with this task.\nHere is an example of a task that uses a callout to checkin with the \nsanity task every 50 seconds:\n\n\n#define TASK1_SANITY_CHECKIN_ITVL (50 * OS_TICKS_PER_SEC) \nstruct os_eventq task1_evq;\n\nstatic void\ntask1(void *arg)\n{\n    struct os_task *t;\n    struct os_event *ev;\n    struct os_callout c;\n\n    /* Get current OS task */\n    t = os_sched_get_current_task();\n\n    /* Initialize the event queue. */\n    os_eventq_init(\ntask1_evq);\n\n    /* Initialize the callout */\n    os_callout_init(\nc, \ntask1_evq, NULL);\n\n    /* reset the callout to checkin with the sanity task \n     * in 50 seconds to kick off timing.\n     */\n    os_callout_reset(\nc, TASK1_SANITY_CHECKIN_ITVL);\n\n    while (1) {\n        ev = os_eventq_get(\ntask1_evq);\n\n        /* The sanity timer has reset */\n        if (ev-\nev_arg == \nc) {\n            os_sanity_task_checkin(t);\n        } else {\n            /* not expecting any other events */\n            assert(0);\n        }\n    }\n\n    /* Should never reach */\n    assert(0);\n}\n\n\n\n\nRegistering a Custom Sanity Check\n\n\nIf a particular task wants to further hook into the sanity framework to \nperform other checks during the sanity task's operation, it can do so by\nregistering a \nstruct os_sanity_check\n using the \nos_sanity_check_register\n\nfunction.\n\n\nstatic int \nmymodule_perform_sanity_check(struct os_sanity_check *sc, void *arg)\n{\n    /* Perform your checking here.  In this case, we check if there \n     * are available buffers in mymodule, and return 0 (all good)\n     * if true, and -1 (error) if not.\n     */\n    if (mymodule_has_buffers()) {\n        return (0);\n    } else {\n        return (-1);\n    }\n}\n\nstatic int \nmymodule_register_sanity_check(void)\n{\n    struct os_sanity_check sc;\n\n    os_sanity_check_init(\nsc);\n    /* Only assert() if mymodule_perform_sanity_check() fails 50 \n     * times.  SANITY_TASK_INTERVAL is defined by the user, and \n     * is the frequency at which the sanity_task runs in seconds.\n     */\n    OS_SANITY_CHECK_SETFUNC(\nsc, mymodule_perform_sanity_check, NULL, \n        50 * SANITY_TASK_INTERVAL);\n\n    rc = os_sanity_check_register(\nsc);\n    if (rc != 0) {\n        goto err;\n    } \n\n    return (0);\nerr:\n    return (rc);\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn the above example, every time the custom sanity check \n\nmymodule_perform_sanity_check\n returns successfully (0), \nthe sanity check is reset.  In the \nOS_SANITY_CHECK_SETFUNC\n macro,\nthe sanity checkin interval is specified as 50 * SANITY_TASK_INTERVAL \n(which is the interval at which the sanity task runs.)  This means \nthat the \nmymodule_perform_sanity_check()\n function needs to fail\n50 times consecutively before the sanity task will crash the system.\n\n\nTIP:\n  When checking things like memory buffers, which can be temporarily \nbe exhausted, it's a good idea to have the sanity check fail multiple \nconsecutive times before crashing the system.  This will avoid crashing\nfor temporary failures.\n\n\nData structures\n\n\nOS Sanity Check\n\n\nstruct os_sanity_check {\n    os_time_t sc_checkin_last;\n    os_time_t sc_checkin_itvl;\n    os_sanity_check_func_t sc_func;\n    void *sc_arg; \n\n    SLIST_ENTRY(os_sanity_check) sc_next;\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElement\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsc_checkin_last\n\n\nThe last time this sanity check checked in with the sanity task, in OS time ticks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsc_checkin_itvl\n\n\nHow frequently the sanity check is supposed to check in with the sanity task, in OS time ticks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsc_func\n\n\nIf not \nNULL\n, call this function when running the sanity task.

In that case you would use a console stub. \n\n\nAnother example would be the bootloader project where we want to keep the size of the image small. It includes the \nlibs/os\n egg that can print out messages on a console (e.g. if there is a hard fault) and the \nlibs/util\n egg that uses full console (but only if SHELL is present to provide a CLI). However, we do not want to use any console I/O capability in this particular bootloader project to keep the size small.

It is used when system crashes, and we still want to output info related to that crash.\n\n\nConsole, by default, echoes everything it receives back.

Whether echoing happens or not can be controlled programmatically.",

Hence the \nnffs\n egg description lists \nlibs/fs\n as a dependency. \n\n\negg.name: libs/nffs\negg.vers: 0.1\negg.identities: NFFS\negg.deps:\n    - libs/os\n    - libs/fs\n    - libs/testutil\n    - hw/hal\n\n\n\n\nIf the user wishes to use a different flash file system (say, \"ownffs\"), the directory containing \"ownffs\" code must include the \negg.yml\n file stating the dependency on \nlibs/fs\n listed as shown above. \"ownffs\" uses the \nlibs/fs\n API available in mynewt, thus minimizing changes to other parts of the project.\n\n\nNote that this generic file system (\nfs\n) API does not expose any file system detection, initialization, and formatting functions. These function calls remain specific to the chosen file system. For example, Project Slinky uses the default Newtron File System (nffs) and therefore calls nffs_init() to initialize the nffs memory and data structures before any other file system operations are attempted. As shown below, the egg for Project Slinky includes the \nlibs/imgmgr\n egg which in turn includes the \nlibs/bootutil\n egg. The egg description for \nlibs/bootutil\n specifies \nfs/nffs\n as a dependency.\n\n\n\n    egg.name: project/slinky\n    egg.vers: 0.1\n    egg.deps:\n        - libs/os\n        - libs/console/full\n        - libs/shell\n        - libs/newtmgr\n        - libs/imgmgr\n        - sys/config\n        - sys/log\n        - sys/stats\n\n\n\n\n\n    egg.name: libs/imgmgr\n    egg.vers: 0.1\n    egg.deps:\n        - libs/newtmgr\n        - libs/bootutil\n    egg.deps.FS:\n        - fs/fs\n    egg.cflags.FS: -DFS_PRESENT\n\n\n\n\n\n    egg.name: libs/bootutil\n    egg.vers: 0.1 \n    egg.deps: \n        - fs/nffs\n        - libs/os \n        - libs/testutil\n        - hw/hal\n\n\n\n\nData Structures\n\n\nAPI\n\n\n   struct fs_file;\n\n\n\n\nThe functions available in this OS feature are:\n\n\n\n\nfs_open\n\n\nfs_close\n\n\nfs_read\n\n\nfs_write\n\n\nfs_seek\n\n\nfs_getpos\n\n\nfs_filelen\n\n\nfs_unlink\n\n\nfs_rename\n\n\nfs_mkdir\n\n\nfs_opendir\n\n\nfs_readdir\n\n\nfs_closedir\n\n\nfs_dirent_name\n\n\nfs_dirent_is_dir\n\n\n\n\nAdditional file system utilities that bundle some of the basic functions above are:\n\n\n\n\nfsutil_read_file\n\n\nfsutil_write_file\n\n\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\n\n\n fs_open \n\n\n    int\n    fs_open(const char *filename, uint8_t access_flags, struct fs_file **out_file);\n\n\n\n\nOpens a file at the specified path.

An area is a region\nof disk with the following properties:\n\n\n\n\nAn area can be fully erased without affecting any other areas.\n\n\nA write to one area does not restrict writes to other areas.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: Some flash hardware divides its memory space into \"blocks.\"  Writes within a block must be sequential, but writes to one block have no effect on what parts of other blocks can be written.  Thus, for flash hardware with such a restriction, each area must comprise a discrete number of blocks.\n\n\nWhile not strictly necessary, it is recommended that all areas have the same\nsize.\n\n\nOn disk, each area is prefixed with the following header:\n\n\n/** On-disk representation of an area header. */\nstruct nffs_disk_area {\n    uint32_t nda_magic[4];  /* NFFS_AREA_MAGIC{0,1,2,3} */\n    uint32_t nda_length;    /* Total size of area, in bytes. */\n    uint8_t nda_ver;        /* Current nffs version: 0 */\n    uint8_t nda_gc_seq;     /* Garbage collection count. */\n    uint8_t reserved8;\n    uint8_t nda_id;         /* 0xff if scratch area. */\n};\n\n\n\n\nBeyond its header, an area contains a sequence of disk objects, representing\nthe contents of the file system.

The result is the greatest number which satisfies all of\nthe following restrictions:\n    o No more than 2048.\n    o At least two maximum-sized blocks can fit in the smallest area.\n\n\nThe 2048 number was chosen somewhat arbitrarily, and may change in the future.\n\n\nID space\n\n\nAll disk objects have a unique 32-bit ID.  The ID space is partitioned as\nfollows:\n      * 0x00000000 - 0x0fffffff: Directory inodes.\n      * 0x10000000 - 0x7fffffff: File inodes.\n      * 0x80000000 - 0xfffffffe: Data blocks.\n      * 0xffffffff             : Reserved (NFFS_ID_NONE)\n\n\nScratch area\n\n\nA valid nffs file system must contain a single \"scratch area.\"  The scratch\narea does not contain any objects of its own, and is only used during garbage\ncollection.  The scratch area must have a size greater than or equal to each\nof the other areas in flash.\n\n\nRAM representation\n\n\nEvery object in the file system is stored in a 256-entry hash table.  An\nobject's hash key is derived from its 32-bit ID.  Each list in the hash table\nis sorted by time of use; most-recently-used is at the front of the list. All\nobjects are represented by the following structure:\n\n\n/**\n * What gets stored in the hash table.  Each entry represents a data block or\n * an inode.\n */\nstruct nffs_hash_entry {\n    SLIST_ENTRY(nffs_hash_entry) nhe_next;\n    uint32_t nhe_id;        /* 0 - 0x7fffffff if inode; else if block. */\n    uint32_t nhe_flash_loc; /* Upper-byte = area idx; rest = area offset. */\n};\n\n\n\n\nFor each data block, the above structure is all that is stored in RAM.  To\nacquire more information about a data block, the block header must be read\nfrom flash.\n\n\nInodes require a fuller RAM representation to capture the structure of the\nfile system.  There are two types of inodes: \nfiles\n and \ndirectories\n.  Each\ninode hash entry is actually an instance of the following structure:\n\n\n/** Each inode hash entry is actually one of these. */\nstruct nffs_inode_entry {\n    struct nffs_hash_entry nie_hash_entry;\n    SLIST_ENTRY(nffs_inode_entry) nie_sibling_next;\n    union {\n        struct nffs_inode_list nie_child_list;           /* If directory */\n        struct nffs_hash_entry *nie_last_block_entry;    /* If file */\n    };\n    uint8_t nie_refcnt;\n};\n\n\n\n\nA directory inode contains a list of its child files and directories\n(fie_child_list).  These entries are sorted alphabetically using the ASCII\ncharacter set.\n\n\nA file inode contains a pointer to the last data block in the file\n(nie_last_block_entry).  For most file operations, the reversed block list must\nbe walked backwards.  This introduces a number of speed inefficiencies:\n    * All data blocks must be read to determine the length of the file.\n    * Data blocks often need to be processed sequentially.  The reversed\n      nature of the block list transforms this from linear time to an O(n^2)\n      operation.\n\n\nFurthermore, obtaining information about any constituent data block requires a\nseparate flash read.\n\n\nInode cache and Data Block cache\n\n\nThe speed issues are addressed by a pair of caches.  Cached inodes entries\ncontain the file length and a much more convenient doubly-linked list of\ncached data blocks.  The benefit of using caches is that the size of the\ncaches need not be proportional to the size of the file system.  In other\nwords, caches can address speed efficiency concerns without negatively\nimpacting the file system's scalability.\n\n\nnffs requires both caches during normal operation, so it is not possible to\ndisable them.  However, the cache sizes are configurable, and both caches can\nbe configured with a size of one if RAM usage must be minimized.\n\n\nThe following data structures are used in the inode and data block caches.\n\n\n/** Full data block representation; not stored permanently in RAM. */\nstruct nffs_block {\n    struct nffs_hash_entry *nb_hash_entry;   /* Points to real block entry. */\n    uint32_t nb_seq;                         /* Sequence number; greater\n                                                supersedes lesser. */\n    struct nffs_inode_entry *nb_inode_entry; /* Owning inode. */\n    struct nffs_hash_entry *nb_prev;         /* Previous block in file. */\n    uint16_t nb_data_len;                    /* # of data bytes in block. */\n    uint16_t reserved16;\n};\n\n/** Represents a single cached data block. */\nstruct nffs_cache_block {\n    TAILQ_ENTRY(nffs_cache_block) ncb_link; /* Next / prev cached block. */\n    struct nffs_block ncb_block;            /* Full data block. */\n    uint32_t ncb_file_offset;               /* File offset of this block. */\n};\n\n/** Full inode representation; not stored permanently in RAM. */\nstruct nffs_inode {\n    struct nffs_inode_entry *ni_inode_entry; /* Points to real inode entry. */\n    uint32_t ni_seq;                         /* Sequence number; greater\n                                                supersedes lesser. */\n    struct nffs_inode_entry *ni_parent;      /* Points to parent directory. */\n    uint8_t ni_filename_len;                 /* # chars in filename. */\n    uint8_t ni_filename[NFFS_SHORT_FILENAME_LEN]; /* First 3 bytes. */\n};\n\n/** Doubly-linked tail queue of cached blocks; contained in cached inodes. */\nTAILQ_HEAD(nffs_block_cache_list, nffs_block_cache_entry);\n\n/** Represents a single cached file inode. */\nstruct nffs_cache_inode {\n    TAILQ_ENTRY(nffs_cache_inode) nci_link;        /* Sorted; LRU at tail. */\n    struct nffs_inode nci_inode;                   /* Full inode. */\n    struct nffs_cache_block_list nci_block_list;   /* List of cached blocks. */\n    uint32_t nci_file_size;                        /* Total file size. */\n};\n\n\n\n\nOnly file inodes are cached; directory inodes are never cached.\n\n\nWithin a cached inode, all cached data blocks are contiguous.  E.g., if the\nstart and end of a file are cached, then the middle must also be cached.  A\ndata block is only cached if its owning file is also cached.\n\n\nInternally, cached inodes are stored in a singly-linked list, ordered by time\nof use.  The most-recently-used entry is the first element in the list.  If a\nnew inode needs to be cached, but the inode cache is full, the\nleast-recently-used entry is freed to make room for the new one.  The\nfollowing operations cause an inode to be cached:\n\n\n\n\nQuerying a file's length.\n\n\nSeeking within a file.\n\n\nReading from a file.\n\n\nWriting to a file.\n\n\n\n\nThe following operations cause a data block to be cached:\n\n\n\n\nReading from the block.\n\n\nWriting to the block.\n\n\n\n\nIf one of the above operations is applied to a data block that is not currently\ncached, nffs uses the following procedure to cache the necessary block:\n\n\n\n\nIf none of the owning inode's blocks are currently cached, allocate a\n       cached block entry corresponding to the requested block and insert it\n       into the inode's list.\n\n\nElse if the requested file offset is less than that of the first cached\n       block, bridge the gap between the inode's sequence of cached blocks and\n       the block that now needs to be cached.  This is accomplished by caching\n       each block in the gap, finishing with the requested block.\n\n\nElse (the requested offset is beyond the end of the cache),\n   a. If the requested offset belongs to the block that immediately follows the end of the cache, cache the block and append it to the list.\n   b. Else, clear the cache, and populate it with the single entry corresponding to the requested block.\n\n\n\n\nIf the system is unable to allocate a cached block entry at any point during\nthe above procedure, the system frees up other blocks currently in the cache. This is accomplished as follows:\n\n\n\n\nIterate the inode cache in reverse (i.e., start with the least-recently-used entry).  For each entry:\n   a. If the entry's cached block list is empty, advance to the next entry.\n   b. Else, free all the cached blocks in the entry's list.\n\n\n\n\nBecause the system imposes a minimum block cache size of one, the above\nprocedure will always reclaim at least one cache block entry.  The above\nprocedure may result in the freeing of the block list that belongs to the very\ninode being operated on.  This is OK, as the final block to get cached is\nalways the block being requested.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nThe file system is configured by populating fields in a global structure.\nEach field in the structure corresponds to a setting.  All configuration must\nbe done prior to calling nffs_init().  The configuration structure is defined\nas follows:\n\n\n\nstruct nffs_config {\n    /** Maximum number of inodes; default=1024. */\n    uint32_t nc_num_inodes;\n\n    /** Maximum number of data blocks; default=4096. */\n    uint32_t nc_num_blocks;\n\n    /** Maximum number of open files; default=4. */\n    uint32_t nc_num_files;\n\n    /** Inode cache size; default=4. */\n    uint32_t nc_num_cache_inodes;\n\n    /** Data block cache size; default=64. */\n    uint32_t nc_num_cache_blocks;\n    };\n\nextern struct nffs_config nffs_config;\n\n\n\n\nAny fields that are set to 0 (or not set at all) inherit the corresponding\ndefault value.  This means that it is impossible to configure any setting with\na value of zero.\n\n\nInitialization\n\n\nThere are two means of initializing an nffs file system:\n\n\n\n\nRestore an existing file system via detection.\n\n\nCreate a new file system via formatting.\n\n\n\n\nBoth methods require the user to describe how the flash memory is divided into\nareas.  This is accomplished with an array of struct nffs_area_desc, defined as\nfollows:\n\n\nstruct nffs_area_desc {\n    uint32_t nad_offset;    /* Flash offset of start of area. */\n    uint32_t nad_length;    /* Size of area, in bytes. */\n};\n\n\n\n\nAn array of area descriptors is terminated by an entry with a fad_length field\nof 0.\n\n\nOne common initialization sequence is the following:\n\n\n\n\nDetect an nffs file system anywhere in flash.\n\n\nIf no file system detected, format a new file system in a specific\n        region of flash.\n\n\n\n\nDetection\n\n\nThe file system detection process consists of scanning a specified set of\nflash regions for valid nffs areas, and then populating the RAM representation\nof the file system with the detected objects.  Detection is initiated with the\nfollowing function:\n\n\n/**\n * Searches for a valid nffs file system among the specified areas.  This\n * function succeeds if a file system is detected among any subset of the\n * supplied areas.  If the area set does not contain a valid file system,\n * a new one can be created via a separate call to nffs_format().\n *\n * @param area_descs        The area set to search.  This array must be\n *                              terminated with a 0-length area.\n *\n * @return                  0 on success;\n *                          NFFS_ECORRUPT if no valid file system was detected;\n *                          other nonzero on error.\n */\nint nffs_detect(const struct nffs_area_desc *area_descs);\n\n\n\n\nAs indicated, not every area descriptor needs to reference a valid nffs area.\nDetection is successful as long as a complete file system is detected\nsomewhere in the specified regions of flash.  If an application is unsure\nwhere a file system might be located, it can initiate detection across the\nentire flash region.\n\n\nA detected file system is valid if:\n\n\n\n\nAt least one non-scratch area is present.\n\n\nAt least one scratch area is present (only the first gets used if there is more than one).\n\n\nThe root directory inode is present.\n\n\n\n\nDuring detection, each indicated region of flash is checked for a valid area\nheader.  The contents of each valid non-scratch area are then restored into\nthe nffs RAM representation.  The following procedure is applied to each object\nin the area:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify the object's integrity via a crc16 check.  If invalid, the object is discarded and the procedure restarts on the next object in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConvert the disk object into its corresponding RAM representation and insert it into the hash table.  If the object is an inode, its reference count is initialized to 1, indicating ownership by its parent directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf an object with the same ID is already present, then one supersedes the other.  Accept the object with the greater sequence number and discard the other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the object references a nonexistant inode (parent directory in the case of an inode; owning file in the case of a data block), insert a temporary \"dummy\" inode into the hash table so that inter-object links can be maintained until the absent inode is eventually restored.  Dummy inodes are identified by a reference count of 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a delete record for an inode is encountered, the inode's parent pointer is set to null to indicate that it should be removed from RAM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf nffs encounters an object that cannot be identified (i.e., its magic number\nis not valid), it scans the remainder of the flash area for the next valid\nmagic number.  Upon encountering a valid object, nffs resumes the procedure\ndescribed above.\n\n\nAfter all areas have been restored, a sweep is performed across the entire RAM\nrepresentation so that invalid inodes can be deleted from memory.\n\n\nFor each directory inode:\n\n\n\n\nIf its reference count is 0 (i.e., it is a dummy), migrate its children to the /lost+found directory, and delete it from the RAM representation. This should only happen in the case of file system corruption.\n\n\nIf its parent reference is null (i.e., it was deleted), delete it and all its children from the RAM representation.\n\n\n\n\nFor each file inode:\n\n\n\n\nIf its reference count is 0 (i.e., it is a dummy), delete it from the RAM representation.  This should only happen in the case of file system corruption.  (We should try to migrate the file to the lost+found directory in this case, as mentioned in the todo section).\n\n\n\n\nWhen an object is deleted during this sweep, it is only deleted from the RAM\nrepresentation; nothing is written to disk.\n\n\nWhen objects are migrated to the lost+found directory, their parent inode\nreference is permanently updated on the disk.\n\n\nIn addition, a single scratch area is identified during the detection process.\nThe first area whose 'fda_id' value is set to 0xff is designated as the file\nsystem scratch area.  If no valid scratch area is found, the cause could be\nthat the system was restarted while a garbage collection cycle was in progress.\nSuch a condition is identified by the presence of two areas with the same ID.\nIn such a case, the shorter of the two areas is erased and designated as the\nscratch area.\n\n\nFormatting\n\n\nA new file system is created via formatting.  Formatting is achieved via the\nfollowing function:\n\n\n/**\n * Erases all the specified areas and initializes them with a clean nffs\n * file system.\n *\n * @param area_descs        The set of areas to format.\n *\n * @return                  0 on success;\n *                          nonzero on failure.\n */\nint nffs_format(const struct nffs_area_desc *area_descs);\n\n\n\n\nOn success, an area header is written to each of the specified locations.  The\nlargest area in the set is designated as the initial scratch area.\n\n\nFlash writes\n\n\nThe nffs implementation always writes in a strictly sequential fashion within an\narea.  For each area, the system keeps track of the current offset.  Whenever\nan object gets written to an area, it gets written to that area's current\noffset, and the offset is increased by the object's disk size.\n\n\nWhen a write needs to be performed, the nffs implementation selects the\nappropriate destination area by iterating though each area until one with\nsufficient free space is encountered.\n\n\nThere is no write buffering.  Each call to a write function results in a write\noperation being sent to the flash hardware.\n\n\nNew objects\n\n\nWhenever a new object is written to disk, it is assigned the following\nproperties:\n    * ID: A unique value is selected from the 32-bit ID space, as appropriate\n      for the object's type.\n    * Sequence number: 0\n\n\nWhen a new file or directory is created, a corresponding inode is written to\nflash.  Likewise, a new data block also results in the writing of a\ncorresponding disk object.\n\n\nMoving/Renaming files and directories\n\n\nWhen a file or directory is moved or renamed, its corresponding inode is\nrewritten to flash with the following properties:\n\n\n\n\nID: Unchanged\n\n\nSequence number: Previous value plus one.\n\n\nParent inode: As specified by the move / rename operation.\n\n\nFilename: As specified by the move / rename operation.\n\n\n\n\nBecause the inode's ID is unchanged, all dependent objects remain valid.\n\n\nUnlinking files and directories\n\n\nWhen a file or directory is unlinked from its parent directory, a deletion\nrecord for the unlinked inode gets written to flash.  The deletion record is an\ninode with the following properties:\n\n\n\n\nID: Unchanged\n\n\nSequence number: Previous value plus one.\n\n\nParent inode ID: NFFS_ID_NONE\n\n\n\n\nWhen an inode is unlinked, no deletion records need to be written for the\ninode's dependent objects (constituent data blocks or child inodes).  During\nthe next file system detection, it is recognized that the objects belong to\na deleted inode, so they are not restored into the RAM representation.\n\n\nIf a file has an open handle at the time it gets unlinked, application code\ncan continued to use the file handle to read and write data.  All files retain\na reference count, and a file isn't deleted from the RAM representation until\nits reference code drops to 0.  Any attempt to open an unlinked file fails,\neven if the file is referenced by other file handles.\n\n\nWriting to a file\n\n\nThe following procedure is used whenever the application code writes to a file.\nFirst, if the write operation specifies too much data to fit into a single\nblock, the operation is split into several separate write operations.  Then,\nfor each write operation:\n\n\n1. Determine which existing blocks the write operation overlaps (n = number of overwritten blocks).\n\n\n2. If n = 0, this is an append operation.  Write a data block with the following properties:\n\n\n\n\nID: New unique value.\n\n\nSequence number: 0.\n\n\n\n\n3. Else (n \n 1), this write overlaps existing data.\n\n\n(a) For each block in [1, 2, ... n-1], write a new block containing the updated contents.  Each new block supersedes the block it overwrites.  That is, each block has the following properties:\n\n\n\n\nID: Unchanged\n\n\nSequence number: Previous value plus one.\n\n\n\n\n(b) Write the nth block.  The nth block includes all appended data, if any.  As with the other blocks, its ID is unchanged and its sequence number is incremented.\n\n\nAppended data can only be written to the end of the file.  That is, \"holes\" are\nnot supported.\n\n\nGarbage collection\n\n\nWhen the file system is too full to accomodate a write operation, the system\nmust perform garbage collection to make room.  The garbage collection\nprocedure is described below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe non-scratch area with the lowest garbage collection sequence number is selected as the \"source area.\"  If there are other areas with the same sequence number, the one with the smallest flash offset is selected. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe source area's ID is written to the scratch area's header, transforming it into a non-scratch ID.  This former scratch area is now known as the \"destination area.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RAM representation is exhaustively searched for collectible objects.  The following procedure is applied to each inode in the system:\n\n\n\n\nIf the inode is resident in the source area, copy the inode record to the destination area.\n\n\nIf the inode is a file inode, walk the inode's list of data blocks, starting with the last block in the file.  Each block that is resident in the source area is copied to the destination area.  If there is a run of two or more blocks that are resident in the source area, they are consolidated and copied to the destination area as a single new block (subject to the maximum block size restriction).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe source area is reformatted as a scratch sector (i.e., is is fully erased, and its header is rewritten with an ID of 0xff).  The area's garbage collection sequence number is incremented prior to rewriting the header.  This area is now the new scratch sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous measures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRAM usage:\n\n\n\n\n24 bytes per inode\n\n\n12 bytes per data block\n\n\n36 bytes per inode cache entry\n\n\n32 bytes per data block cache entry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximum filename size: 256 characters (no null terminator required)\n\n\n\n\nDisallowed filename characters: '/' and '\\0'\n\n\n\n\nFuture enhancements\n\n\n\n\nAPI function to traverse a directory.\n\n\nMigrate corrupt files to the /lost+found directory during restore, rather than discarding them from RAM.\n\n\nError correction.\n\n\nEncryption.\n\n\nCompression.",

Thus, for flash hardware with such a restriction, each area must comprise a discrete number of blocks.  While not strictly necessary, it is recommended that all areas have the same\nsize.  On disk, each area is prefixed with the following header:  /** On-disk representation of an area header. */\nstruct nffs_disk_area {\n    uint32_t nda_magic[4];  /* NFFS_AREA_MAGIC{0,1,2,3} */\n    uint32_t nda_length;    /* Total size of area, in bytes. */\n    uint8_t nda_ver;        /* Current nffs version: 0 */\n    uint8_t nda_gc_seq;     /* Garbage collection count. */\n    uint8_t reserved8;\n    uint8_t nda_id;         /* 0xff if scratch area. */\n};  Beyond its header, an area contains a sequence of disk objects, representing\nthe contents of the file system.

Within a cached inode, all cached data blocks are contiguous.  E.g., if the\nstart and end of a file are cached, then the middle must also be cached.  A\ndata block is only cached if its owning file is also cached.  Internally, cached inodes are stored in a singly-linked list, ordered by time\nof use.  The most-recently-used entry is the first element in the list.  If a\nnew inode needs to be cached, but the inode cache is full, the\nleast-recently-used entry is freed to make room for the new one.  The\nfollowing operations cause an inode to be cached:   Querying a file's length.  Seeking within a file.  Reading from a file.  Writing to a file.   The following operations cause a data block to be cached:   Reading from the block.  Writing to the block.   If one of the above operations is applied to a data block that is not currently\ncached, nffs uses the following procedure to cache the necessary block:   If none of the owning inode's blocks are currently cached, allocate a\n       cached block entry corresponding to the requested block and insert it\n       into the inode's list.  Else if the requested file offset is less than that of the first cached\n       block, bridge the gap between the inode's sequence of cached blocks and\n       the block that now needs to be cached.  This is accomplished by caching\n       each block in the gap, finishing with the requested block.  Else (the requested offset is beyond the end of the cache),\n   a. If the requested offset belongs to the block that immediately follows the end of the cache, cache the block and append it to the list.\n   b. Else, clear the cache, and populate it with the single entry corresponding to the requested block.   If the system is unable to allocate a cached block entry at any point during\nthe above procedure, the system frees up other blocks currently in the cache. This is accomplished as follows:   Iterate the inode cache in reverse (i.e., start with the least-recently-used entry).  For each entry:\n   a. If the entry's cached block list is empty, advance to the next entry.\n   b. Else, free all the cached blocks in the entry's list.   Because the system imposes a minimum block cache size of one, the above\nprocedure will always reclaim at least one cache block entry.  The above\nprocedure may result in the freeing of the block list that belongs to the very\ninode being operated on.

If an application is unsure\nwhere a file system might be located, it can initiate detection across the\nentire flash region.  A detected file system is valid if:   At least one non-scratch area is present.  At least one scratch area is present (only the first gets used if there is more than one).  The root directory inode is present.   During detection, each indicated region of flash is checked for a valid area\nheader.  The contents of each valid non-scratch area are then restored into\nthe nffs RAM representation.  The following procedure is applied to each object\nin the area:    Verify the object's integrity via a crc16 check.  If invalid, the object is discarded and the procedure restarts on the next object in the area.    Convert the disk object into its corresponding RAM representation and insert it into the hash table.  If the object is an inode, its reference count is initialized to 1, indicating ownership by its parent directory.    If an object with the same ID is already present, then one supersedes the other.  Accept the object with the greater sequence number and discard the other.    If the object references a nonexistant inode (parent directory in the case of an inode; owning file in the case of a data block), insert a temporary \"dummy\" inode into the hash table so that inter-object links can be maintained until the absent inode is eventually restored.  Dummy inodes are identified by a reference count of 0.    If a delete record for an inode is encountered, the inode's parent pointer is set to null to indicate that it should be removed from RAM.    If nffs encounters an object that cannot be identified (i.e., its magic number\nis not valid), it scans the remainder of the flash area for the next valid\nmagic number.  Upon encountering a valid object, nffs resumes the procedure\ndescribed above.  After all areas have been restored, a sweep is performed across the entire RAM\nrepresentation so that invalid inodes can be deleted from memory.  For each directory inode:   If its reference count is 0 (i.e., it is a dummy), migrate its children to the /lost+found directory, and delete it from the RAM representation. This should only happen in the case of file system corruption.  If its parent reference is null (i.e., it was deleted), delete it and all its children from the RAM representation.   For each file inode:   If its reference count is 0 (i.e., it is a dummy), delete it from the RAM representation.  This should only happen in the case of file system corruption.  (We should try to migrate the file to the lost+found directory in this case, as mentioned in the todo section).   When an object is deleted during this sweep, it is only deleted from the RAM\nrepresentation; nothing is written to disk.  When objects are migrated to the lost+found directory, their parent inode\nreference is permanently updated on the disk.  In addition, a single scratch area is identified during the detection process.\nThe first area whose 'fda_id' value is set to 0xff is designated as the file\nsystem scratch area.  If no valid scratch area is found, the cause could be\nthat the system was restarted while a garbage collection cycle was in progress.\nSuch a condition is identified by the presence of two areas with the same ID.\nIn such a case, the shorter of the two areas is erased and designated as the\nscratch area.",

Documentation is available in the form of  on-line manual pages or at [https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi](#https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi).  `mynewt.c` adds two new functions listed in the Function reference section.\n\n* asprintf.c    \n* atoi.c    \n* atol.c\n* atoll.c   \n* bsearch.c \n* bzero.c   \n* calloc.c  \n* fgets.c    \n* inline.c  \n* jrand48.c \n* lrand48.c \n* malloc.c  \n* malloc.h  \n* memccpy.c \n* memchr.c  \n* memcmp.c  \n* memcpy.c  \n* memfile.c \n* memmem.c  \n* memmove.c \n* memrchr.c \n* memset.c  \n* memswap.c \n* mrand48.c \n* mynewt.c  \n* nrand48.c \n* qsort.c   \n* realloc.c \n* sprintf.c \n* srand48.c \n* sscanf.c  \n* strcasecmp.c  \n* strcat.c  \n* strchr.c  \n* strcmp.c  \n* strcpy.c  \n* strcspn.c \n* strdup.c  \n* strlcat.c \n* strlcpy.c \n* strlen.c  \n* strncasecmp.c \n* strncat.c \n* strncmp.c \n* strncpy.c \n* strndup.c \n* strnlen.c \n* strntoimax.c  \n* strntoumax.c  \n* strpbrk.c \n* strrchr.c \n* strsep.c  \n* strspn.c  \n* strstr.c  \n* strtoimax.c   \n* strtok.c  \n* strtok_r.c    \n* strtol.c  \n* strtoll.c \n* strtoul.c \n* strtoull.c    \n* strtoumax.c   \n* templates \n* test  \n* tinyprintf.c  \n* vasprintf.c   \n* vprintf.c \n* vsprintf.c    \n* vsscanf.c \n\n## Function Reference\n\n------------------\n\n##  font color= F2853F  style= font-size:24pt  stdin_read  /font \n\n```no-highlight\n    static size_t\n    stdin_read(FILE *fp, char *bp, size_t n)  Read from a file.",

            "text": "Building newt tool on your Mac\n\n\nGetting your Mac Ready\n\n\nIf you want to build the newt tool from its source code you need to install \n\n\nInstalling Homebrew to ease installs on OS X\n\n\n\n\nDo you have Homebrew? If not, open a terminal on your Mac and paste the following at a Terminal prompt. It will ask you for your sudo password.\n\n\n\n\n        $ ruby -e \n$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can just extract (or \ngit clone\n) Homebrew and install it to \n/usr/local\n.\n\n\nInstalling Go\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe directory structure must be first readied for using Go. Go code must be kept inside a workspace. A workspace is a directory hierarchy with three directories at its root:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsrc contains Go source files organized into packages (one package per directory),\n\n\n\n\n\n\npkg contains package objects, and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbin contains executable commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GOPATH environment variable specifies the location of your workspace. First create a 'dev' directory and then a 'go' directory under it. Set the GOPATH environment variable to this directory where you will soon clone the newt tool repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        $ cd $HOME\n        $ mkdir -p dev/go  \n        $ cd dev/go\n        $ export GOPATH=`pwd`\n\n\n\n\nNote that you need to add export statements to ~/.bash_profile to export variables permanently. Don't forget to source the file for the change to go into effect.\n\n\n        $ vi ~/.bash_profile\n        $ source ~/.bash_profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext you will use Homebrew to install Go. The summary message at the end of the installation should indicate that it is installed in the /usr/local/Cellar/go/ directory. You will use the Go command 'install' to compile and install packages (called eggs in the Mynewt world) and dependencies. \n\n\n\n\n        $ brew install go\n        ==\n \n        ...\n        ... \n        ==\n *Summary*\n        \ud83c\udf7a  /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.5.1: 5330 files, 273M\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can download the Go package directly from (https://golang.org/dl/) instead of brewing it. Install it in /usr/local directory.\n\n\nCreating local repository\n\n\n\n\nYou are ready to download the newt tool repository. You will use Go to copy the directory (currently the asf incubator directory). Be patient as it may take a minute or two. Check the directories installed.\n\n\n\n\n        $ go get git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-newt.git/newt\n        $ ls\n         bin    pkg    src\n        $ ls src\n        git-wip-us.apache.org   github.com      gopkg.in\n\n\n\n\nIf you run into an \nunrecognized import path\n issue, go to the \n~/dev/go/src/git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf\n directory and create a symbolic link\n\n\n        $ ln -s incubator-mynewt-newt.git incubator-mynewt-newt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck that newt.go is in place.\n\n\n\n\n        $ ls $GOPATH/src/git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-newt.git/newt  \n        Godeps          README.md       coding_style.txt    newt.go\n        LICENSE         cli             design.txt\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the Newt tool\n\n\n\n\nYou will use Go to run the newt.go program to build the newt tool. The command used is \ngo install\n which compiles and writes the resulting executable to an output file named \nnewt\n. It installs the results along with its dependencies in $GOPATH/bin.\n\n\n\n\n        $ cd $GOPATH/src/git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-newt.git/newt\n        $ go install\n        $ ls \n$GOPATH\n/bin/\n        godep       incubator-mynewt-newt.git     newt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry running newt using the compiled binary. For example, check for the version number by typing 'newt version'. See all the possible commands available to a user of newt by typing 'newt -h'.\n\n\n\n\nNote: If you are going to be be modifying the newt tool itself often and wish to compile the program every time you call it, you may want to store the command in a variable in your .bash_profile. So type in \nexport newt=\"go run $GOPATH/src/git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-newt.git/newt/newt/go\"\n in your .bash_profile and execute it by calling \n$newt\n at the prompt instead of \nnewt\n.

A command can have children commands which are also simply referred to as commands. One or more arguments may need to be provided to a command to execute it correctly. \n\n\nIn the example below, the \nnewt\n command has the child command \ntarget set\n. The first argument 'my_target1' is the name of the target whose attributes are being set. The second argument 'arch=cortex_m4' specifies the value to set the attribute (variable) 'arch' to, which in this case is 'cortex_m4'. \n\n\n    newt target set my_target1 arch=cortex_m4\n\n\n\n\nGlobal flags work on all newt commands in the same way. An example is the flag \n-v, --verbose\n to ask for a verbose output while executing a command. The help flag \n-h\n or  \n--help\n is available on all commands but provides command specific output, of course. These flags may be specified in either a long or a short form. \n\n\nA command may additionally take flags specific to it. For example, the \n-b\n flag may be used with \nnewt egg install\n to tell it which branch to install the egg from. \n\n\n    newt egg install -b \nbranchname\n \neggname\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the newt tool \nreference\n in this documentation set, command-line help is available for each command (and child command).

            "text": "In the newt tool, commands represent actions and flags are modifiers for those actions. A command can have children commands which are also simply referred to as commands. One or more arguments may need to be provided to a command to execute it correctly.   In the example below, the  newt  command has the child command  target set . The first argument 'my_target1' is the name of the target whose attributes are being set. The second argument 'arch=cortex_m4' specifies the value to set the attribute (variable) 'arch' to, which in this case is 'cortex_m4'.       newt target set my_target1 arch=cortex_m4  Global flags work on all newt commands in the same way. An example is the flag  -v, --verbose  to ask for a verbose output while executing a command. The help flag  -h  or   --help  is available on all commands but provides command specific output, of course. These flags may be specified in either a long or a short form.   A command may additionally take flags specific to it. For example, the  -b  flag may be used with  newt egg install  to tell it which branch to install the egg from.       newt egg install -b  branchname   eggname   In addition to the newt tool  reference  in this documentation set, command-line help is available for each command (and child command). Simply use the flag  -h  or  --help  as shown below:      $ newt target export --help\n    Export build targets from the current nest, and print them to \n    standard output.

Currently, you need to create a symbolic link for all the directory references in the go scripts to work correctly.\n\n\n        $ cd ~/dev\n        $ go get git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-newt.git/newt\n        $ ln -s ~/dev/go/src/git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-newt.git ~/dev/go/src/git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-newt\n\n        $ pwd\n       /Users/\nuser\n/dev/go\n        $ ls\n         bin    pkg    src\n        $ cd src/git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-newt/newt\n        $ ls\n        newt    newtmgr    newtvm   util\n        $ cd newtmgr\n        $ go build\n        $ \n\n\n\n\nNote: If the \ngo build\n command results in errors indicating some package cannot be found, do a \ngo get\n to download all the third-party files needed from github.com and then run \ngo build\n again. \n\n\nBuilding Targets\n\n\nYou will create a total of 4 targets. The first one is a simulation target and the second a hardware target (for STM32-E407 Olimex development board). In order to run an image from the flash on the Olimex board, a bootloader is required. You will build two additional targets (bootloader and bin2img) as explained in Project Blinky under \nUsing flash to make LED blink\n and as shown below.\n\n\nHere;'s how to create the target for simulation.\n\n\n        $ newt target create slinky_sim\n        Creating target slinky_sim\n        Target slinky_sim sucessfully created!\n        $ newt target set slinky_sim arch=sim\n        Target slinky_sim successfully set arch to sim\n        $ newt target set slinky_sim compiler=sim\n        Target slinky_sim successfully set compiler to sim\n        $ newt target set slinky_sim project=slinky\n        Target slinky_sim successfully set project to slinky\n        $ newt target set slinky_sim compiler_def=debug\n        Target slinky_sim successfully set compiler_def to debug\n        $ newt target set slinky_sim bsp=hw/bsp/native\n        Target slinky_sim successfully set bsp to hw/bsp/native\n        $ newt target show slinky_sim\n        slinky_sim\n            arch: sim\n            bsp: hw/bsp/native\n            compiler: sim\n            compiler_def: debug\n            name: slinky_sim\n            project: slinky     \n\n\n\n\nRepeat the above steps using the attribute information for each target from the target output shown below to create the remaining three targets. The four target definitions are:\n\n\n        $ newt target show\n        bin2img\n            arch: sim\n            bsp: hw/bsp/native\n            compiler: sim\n            compiler_def: debug\n            name: bin2img\n            project: bin2img\n        boot_olimex\n            arch: cortex_m4\n            bsp: hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard\n            compiler: arm-none-eabi-m4\n            compiler_def: optimized\n            name: boot_olimex\n            project: boot\n        slinky1\n            arch: cortex_m4\n            bsp: hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard\n            compiler: arm-none-eabi-m4\n            compiler_def: debug\n            name: slinky1\n            project: slinky\n        slinky_sim\n            arch: sim\n            bsp: hw/bsp/native\n            compiler: sim\n            compiler_def: debug\n            name: slinky_sim\n            project: slinky\n\n\n\n\nGo ahead and build all the targets. The build command for slinky_sim is shown below.\n\n\n        $ newt target build slinky_sim\n        Building target slinky_sim (project = slinky)\n        Compiling base64.c\n        Compiling cbmem.c\n        ...\n        Archiving libnative.a\n        Compiling main.c\n        Building project slinky\n        Linking slinky.elf\n        Successfully run!\n\n\n\n\nNow run the \nnewt target build\n command for the remaining three targets.\n\n\nUsing newtmgr with a sim target\n\n\n\n\nRun the executable you have build for the simulated environment. The serial port name on which the simulated target is connected is shown in the output.\n\n\n\n\n        $ pwd\n        /Users/\nuser\n/dev/larva/project/slinky\n        $ ./bin/slinky_sim/slinky.elf\n        uart0 at /dev/ttys007\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will now set up a connection profile using \nnewtmgr\n for the serial port connection and start communicating with the simulated remote device.\n\n\n\n\n        $ newtmgr conn add sim1 type=serial connstring=/dev/ttys007\n        Connection profile sim1 successfully added\n        $ newtmgr conn show\n        Connection profiles: \n          sim1: type=serial, connstring='/dev/ttys007'\n        $ newtmgr -c sim1 taskstats\n        Return Code = 0\n          uart_poller (prio=0 tid=3 runtime=0 cswcnt=43810 stksize=1024 stkusage=325 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)\n          newtmgr (prio=4 tid=4 runtime=0 cswcnt=6 stksize=1024 stkusage=585 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)\n          task1 (prio=1 tid=5 runtime=0 cswcnt=551 stksize=1024 stkusage=83 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)\n          task2 (prio=2 tid=6 runtime=0 cswcnt=551 stksize=1024 stkusage=85 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)\n          idle (prio=255 tid=0 runtime=552525 cswcnt=44005 stksize=1024 stkusage=529 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)\n          os_sanity (prio=254 tid=1 runtime=0 cswcnt=551 stksize=1024 stkusage=82 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)\n          shell (prio=3 tid=2 runtime=0 cswcnt=20 stksize=1024 stkusage=142 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)\n        $ newtmgr -c sim1 stat stat\n        Return Code = 0\n        Stats Name: stat\n          s0: 1\n\n\n\n\nUsing newtmgr with a remote target\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst make sure the USB A-B type cable is connected to the ARM-USB-TINY-H debugger connector on the Olimex board. \n\n\nNext go the to project directory and download the slinky project image to the flash of the Olimex board. You will see the executables in the \nslinky1\n directory created for the Olimex target to run the slinky project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        $ pwd\n        /Users/\nuser\n/dev/larva/project/slinky\n        $ ls\n        bin     egg.yml     slinky.yml  src\n        $ ls bin\n        slinky1     slinky_sim\n        $ ls bin/slinky1\n        slinky.elf  slinky.elf.bin  slinky.elf.cmd    slinky.elf.img    slinky.elf.lst    slinky.elf.map\n        $ newt target download boot_olimex\n        Downloading with /Users/\nuser\n/dev/larva/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard_download.sh\n        $ newt target download slinky1\n        Downloading with /Users/\nuser\n/dev/larva/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard_download.sh\n\n\n\n\nYou can now disconnect the debugging cable from the board. You should see the green LED blinking. If not, try powercycling the board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you have to set up the serial connection from your computer to the Olimex board. Locate the PC6/USART6_TX (pin#3), PC7/USART6_RX (pin#4), and GND (pin#2) of the UEXT connector on the Olimex board. More information on the UEXT connector can be found at \nhttps://www.olimex.com/Products/Modules/UEXT/\n. The schematic of the board can be found at \nhttps://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/ST/STM32-E407/resources/STM32-E407_sch.pdf\n for reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect the female RX pin of the USB-TTL serial cable to the TX of the UEXT connector on the board. \n\n\nConnect the female TX pin of the USB-TTL serial cable to the RX of the UEXT connector on the board. \n\n\nConnect the GND pin of the USB-TTL serial cable to the GND of the UEXT connector on the board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocate the serial connection established in the /dev directory of your computer. It should be of the type \ntty.usbserial-\nsome identifier\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        $ ls /dev/tty.usbserial-AJ03HAQQ \n        /dev/tty.usbserial-AJ03HAQQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou now have to define a connection profile using newtmgr. You can give it any name you want. The example below shows the connection profile being named as the very imaginative \nolimex01\n.\n\n\n\n\n        $ pwd\n        /Users/\nuser\n/dev/larva/project/slinky\n        $ newtmgr conn add olimex01 type=serial connstring=/dev/tty.usbserial-AJ03HAQQ \n        Connection profile olimex01 successfully added\n        $ newtmgr conn show\n        Connection profiles: \n          sim1: type=serial, connstring='/dev/ttys007'\n          olimex01: type=serial, connstring='/dev/tty.usbserial-AJ03HAQQ'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow go ahead and query the Olimex board to get responses back. The simplest command is the \necho\n command to ask it to respond with the text you send it. \n\n\n\n\n        $ newtmgr echo -c olimex01 hello\n        {\nr\n: \nhello\n}\n        $ newtmgr image -c olimex01 list\n        Images:\n            0 : 11.22.33.44\n        $ newtmgr -c olimex01 taskstats\n        Return Code = 0\n          shell (prio=3 tid=1 runtime=0 cswcnt=5 stksize=1024 stkusage=60 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)\n          newtmgr (prio=4 tid=2 runtime=0 cswcnt=4 stksize=1024 stkusage=256 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)\n          task1 (prio=1 tid=3 runtime=0 cswcnt=23 stksize=1024 stkusage=32 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)\n          task2 (prio=2 tid=4 runtime=0 cswcnt=24 stksize=1024 stkusage=33 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)\n          idle (prio=255 tid=0 runtime=23121 cswcnt=26 stksize=32 stkusage=16 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)",

Next go the to project directory and download the slinky project image to the flash of the Olimex board.

You should see the green LED blinking. If not, try powercycling the board.    Now you have to set up the serial connection from your computer to the Olimex board. Locate the PC6/USART6_TX (pin#3), PC7/USART6_RX (pin#4), and GND (pin#2) of the UEXT connector on the Olimex board. More information on the UEXT connector can be found at  https://www.olimex.com/Products/Modules/UEXT/ . The schematic of the board can be found at  https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/ST/STM32-E407/resources/STM32-E407_sch.pdf  for reference.    Connect the female RX pin of the USB-TTL serial cable to the TX of the UEXT connector on the board.   Connect the female TX pin of the USB-TTL serial cable to the RX of the UEXT connector on the board.   Connect the GND pin of the USB-TTL serial cable to the GND of the UEXT connector on the board.     Locate the serial connection established in the /dev directory of your computer. It should be of the type  tty.usbserial- some identifier .            $ ls /dev/tty.usbserial-AJ03HAQQ \n        /dev/tty.usbserial-AJ03HAQQ   You now have to define a connection profile using newtmgr. You can give it any name you want. The example below shows the connection profile being named as the very imaginative  olimex01 .           $ pwd\n        /Users/ user /dev/larva/project/slinky\n        $ newtmgr conn add olimex01 type=serial connstring=/dev/tty.usbserial-AJ03HAQQ \n        Connection profile olimex01 successfully added\n        $ newtmgr conn show\n        Connection profiles: \n          sim1: type=serial, connstring='/dev/ttys007'\n          olimex01: type=serial, connstring='/dev/tty.usbserial-AJ03HAQQ'   Now go ahead and query the Olimex board to get responses back. The simplest command is the  echo  command to ask it to respond with the text you send it.            $ newtmgr echo -c olimex01 hello\n        { r :  hello }\n        $ newtmgr image -c olimex01 list\n        Images:\n            0 : 11.22.33.44\n        $ newtmgr -c olimex01 taskstats\n        Return Code = 0\n          shell (prio=3 tid=1 runtime=0 cswcnt=5 stksize=1024 stkusage=60 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)\n          newtmgr (prio=4 tid=2 runtime=0 cswcnt=4 stksize=1024 stkusage=256 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)\n          task1 (prio=1 tid=3 runtime=0 cswcnt=23 stksize=1024 stkusage=32 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)\n          task2 (prio=2 tid=4 runtime=0 cswcnt=24 stksize=1024 stkusage=33 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)\n          idle (prio=255 tid=0 runtime=23121 cswcnt=26 stksize=32 stkusage=16 last_checkin=0 next_checkin=0)",
